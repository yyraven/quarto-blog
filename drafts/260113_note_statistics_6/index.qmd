## Introduction

Markov process, i.e., the stochastic process where the future state depends *only* on the *present state* (rather than the entire past history - sometimes also called *memorylessness*), is often used in modeling for uncertain but predictable transitions. This concept is widely used in various aspects of bioinformatics, like the build of substitution matrices (e.g., Dayhoff/PAM matrix), gene prediction (e.g., GeneMark), and gene annotation (e.g., HMM). 

[I'm sure I've encountered the term *'Markov process'* in the anime *Neon Genesis Evangelion* before I actually learnt it in class, but I could not find it anywhere online. If you know, please tell me in the comment section, I'm going to get a screenshot of it!]{.blur}

I decide to write my stats notes taken from those classes into easy-to-read articles and publish them, since I want to get an A in the stats class I'm taking this semester, practice typing *LaTex*, and have a quick reference whenever needed rather than search for 'how to perform ANOVA in R' by Google.
