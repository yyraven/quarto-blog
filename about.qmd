### Why Blogging

This blog started as a class project to build a professional profile. Over time, I decided to make it more personal. Blogging offers a peaceful online experience without big company manipulation - no ads, no infinite scrolling, no censorship. So, what you'll see here would be a mix of life science-related and more fun/personal posts. You can filter them by tags.

个人生活/兴趣内容主要用中文写作

### Why's it called *'Raven's Nest'*

*'Raven'* is my online name, so I adopted it as my logo. Corvids like shiny trinkets, and I think blogging nowadays is like collecting and displaying trinkets online - maybe there are some inherent resemblance?

When I lived in Baltimore, I used to see flocks of crows gathering on trees during colder times at dusk and dawn. Sometimes what you think that are leaves would actually be a flock of birds. I tried to re-create that effect in the homepage XD
