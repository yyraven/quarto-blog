This less-known genre, also called 'the scene that celebrates itself', rose from the noise pop scene in the late 80s and early 90s, and has regained popularity recently. An article titled *'The Shoegaze Revival Hit Its Stride in 2023'* [@sherburne_shoegaze_2023] by pitchfork also captures the revival of shoegaze among GenZ populations.\n\n::: column-margin\n![My bloody valentine's 1988 EP 'You made me realise' is a classic shoegaze record.](photo/Youmademerealise.png)\n:::\n\nShoegaze is characterized by heavy use of overdriven guitar and various effect pedals with the combination of the ethereal vocals; the lyrics are often regarded as blank, poetic, and sometimes difficult to distinguish from the instruments. So here comes this project for the indieheads - I want to analyze those usually overlooked lyrics, especially from the perspective of sentiment.\n\nThe bands I want to study are the so-called classic 'big-three' of shoegaze: *my bloody valentine*, *Ride*, and *slowdive*. They were all on the independent record label *Creation* from London, UK, reached their peak in early 90s, disbanded in late 90s due to the fading of the subgenre, and reunited in the 21st century, which make them a perfect fit to study the changes in the lyrics over the years.\n\n## My Questions\n\n1.  What words frequently appear in their lyrics?\n2.  Which bands have the longest and shortest lyrics?\n3.  Who is the saddest shoegaze band?\n4.  Are bands trending towards happiness or sadness over time?\n\n# Project\n\n## Data Acquisition & Wrangling\n\n::: column-margin\n![](photo/loveless.png) ![](photo/nowhere.jpg) ![](photo/souvlaki.jpeg)\n:::\n\n### Data Acquisition\n\nLyrics from all studio albums of the 'big three' bands in the shoegaze genre - *my bloody valentine (mbv)*, *Ride*, and *slowdive* - are retrieved from [Genius.com](https://genius.com/) using a Python package named [lyricsgenius](https://www.johnwmillr.com/scraping-genius-lyrics/) [@miller_johnwmillrlyricsgenius_2024] based on Genius API.

It is also interesting to observe that the latest albums of mbv, Ride, and Slowdive are all among the saddest of their entire careers.\n\n# Bonus: Here Comes the RIDE Fan!\n\nRIDE blew my mind when I attended their Nowhere concert with the Charlatans back in Jan 2024 in the amazing venue Union Transfer, Philadelphia. Since then I've become a huge fan... So I couldn't help but did more data analysis on them (!).\n\n**Disclaimer**: I'm by no means overlooking the members who do not write the lyrics.
