description: This page introduces the Quarto theme 'MYnature'.
---

'MYnature' is a customization based on the Bootstrap 'Morph' theme. It's just a parody for the classic **nature** journal website. Please, accept my paper!

## Features

- **Make your posts look like they're from a top journal.** - used Google Fonts Spectral (title), Libertinus Sans (body), Roboto (caption, navbar, sidebar etc.), and Fira Code (code).
    
    - Can be used for both English and Simplified Chinese blogs (Noto Serif SC for all serif content, and Noto Sans SC for all sans).
    - Nature actually uses **Harding**, their customized font. 

- Supports mobile browsers.

- No dark mode, since nature does not have a dark mode.
