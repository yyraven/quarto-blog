description: Hi, this is my first blog post!

This blog was initially built as a project of the [statistical computing](https://lcolladotor.github.io/jhustatcomputing/) class I'm taking.

## Resources

I used **RStudio** + **GitHub Pages** (rendered to `docs`) to build this page.

Here are some useful resources for a blogging newbie... Will add more in future definitely!
