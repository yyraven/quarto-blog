'Nib/Ink' are customizations based on the Bootstrap 'Morph' theme, aiming for a minimal, elegant, and book-like reading experience.

## Features

- **Book-like reading experience** - used Google Fonts Noto Serif/Noto Serif SC (body) and Fira Code (code).
    
    - Can be used for both English and Simplified Chinese blogs.
    
- **Minimal distraction** - all unnecessary decorative elements are hidden.

- **Easy further customization** - change color scheme by simply editing the `/* Color Palette */` section.

- Supports dark themes and mobile browsers.
