Because it's always been And this should make her feel better But it don't feel like a win At the end of the world This should make me feel better But it don't feel like a win At the end of the worldEmbed"
11,White Sands,Weather Diaries,Ride,16-Jun-17,"3 ContributorsWhite Sands LyricsThe breath between twenty years That same breath tonight We'll always betray ourselves Always hold back time The breath between better days We came the long way round Awakening to be ourselves We died at least once to save our ground Always forever change I wish some things could stay the same I've been thinking of back in time I never knew what was mine- Illusions, Illusions The waves are rocking the winds to rest Lost in our landscapes When we're at our best Breathe in and inspire me Make these our finest hours Time waits for no man What's left behind is oursSee Ride LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also likeEmbed"
