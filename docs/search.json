Both viruses pose significant public health challenges due to their widespread transmission and potential for severe disease.\nClimate and weather conditions can influence the activity and spread of both viruses. Studies have suggested that factors like cold temperatures, low indoor humidity, limited sunlight, and rapid weather changes may increase the risk of disease outbreaks.",

    "text": "Experimental Design\nLet’s imagine a simple scenario:\n\nQuestion: Does salted drinking water affect blood pressure (BP) in mice?\nExperiment:\n\nProvide a mouse with water containing 1% NaCl.\nWait 14 days.\nMeasure BP.\n\n\n\nComparison/Control\nYou need a reference group to see the effect of salted drinking water.\nCommon control group designs could be:\n\nCompare BP in mice fed salt water to BP in mice fed plain water.\nCompare BP in strain A mice fed salt water to BP in strain B mice fed salt water.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdeally, the experimental group is compared to concurrent controls (rather than to historical controls).\n\n\n\n\n\nReplication\nReplicates are needed to 1) reduce the effect of uncontrolled variation (increase precision), and to 2) quantify uncertainty.\nIn this scenario, 10 mouse per group would be a reasonable design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn estimate is of no value without some statement of the uncertainty in the estimate.\n\n\n\n\n\nRandomization\nExperimental subjects (‘units’) should be assigned to treatment groups at random to 1) avoid bias and 2) to control the role of chance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt random does NOT mean haphazardly.\nIt also allows the later use of probability theory, thus giving a solid foundation for statistical analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nStratification/Blocking\nSuppose that some BP measurements will be made in the morning, and some in the afternoon. If you anticipate a difference between morning and the afternoon - ensure that within each period, there are equal numbers of subjects in each treatment group (this is called stratification, or blocking); also, take account of the difference between periods in your analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s imagine we have 6 F mice, 6 M mice; half to be treated (T), half left untreated (C); we can only work with 6 mice per day. How to assign individuals to treatment groups, and to days?\n\nBad Design:\n\n\n\nD1\n\nD2\n\n\n\n\n\nF-T\nF-C\nM-T\nM-C\n\n\nF-T\nF-C\nM-T\nM-C\n\n\nF-T\nF-C\nM-T\nM-C\n\n\n\nRandomized Design:\n\n\n\nD1\n\nD2\n\n\n\n\n\nM-T\nF-C\nM-T\nF-C\n\n\nF-T\nF-T\nM-C\nM-C\n\n\nF-T\nM-T\nF-C\nM-C\n\n\n\nStratified Design:\n\n\n\nD1\n\nD2\n\n\n\n\n\nM-C\nM-C\nM-T\nF-C\n\n\nM-T\nF-T\nF-C\nM-T\n\n\nF-C\nF-T\nM-C\nF-T\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciples of Randomization and Stratification\n\n\n\n\nIf you can (and want to), fix a variable. (e.g., only use 8-week old M mice from a single strain.)\nIf you don’t fix a variable, stratify it. (e.g., use 8 week and 12 week old M mice, and stratify them respect to age.)\nIf you can neither fix nor stratify a variable, randomize it.\n\n\n\n\n\nFactorial Experiments\nSuppose we are interested in the effect of both salt water and a high-fat diet on blood pressure.\nIdeally, we will look at all 4 treatments in 1 experiment; thus, we can 1) learn more (=is there any interactive outcome?). 2) make it more efficient compared to doing all single-factor experiments.\n\n\n\nPlain water\n\nNormal diet\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\nSalt water\n\nHigh-fat diet\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Points to Consider\n\nBlinding: measurements made by people can be influenced by unconscious biases. Ideally, dissections and measurements should be made without knowledge of the treatment applied.\nInternal controls: it can be useful to use the subjects themselves as their own controls (e.g., consider the response after vs. before treatment) to increase precision.\nRepresentativeness: are the subjects/tissues you’re studying really representative of the population you want to study? Ideally, your study material is a stratified random sample from the population of interest.\nPower: Experimental Design considerations (balanced designs) and sample size calculations are crucial, in particular w/ regards to your predictor of interest.",

When we make n independent measurements, we have X_1,X_2,X_3,…,X_n iids, following the population distribution.\nPopulation mean μ: a parameter, fixed quantity, unknown (we want to know) Sample mean X ̅: an estimator of μ, random quantity, a function of the data (X) Observed sample mean x ̅: an estimate of μ, a particular realization of the estimator X ̅, a fixed quantity but the result of a random process. Similarly, population SD σ and sample SD S, …\nSampling Distribution Dependent on type of statistic, population distribution, and the sample size.\nExample:\nConsidering a parameter θ and its estimator θ ̂… • Bias: E(θ ̂−θ)=E(θ ̂ )−θ • Standard Error: SE(θ ̂ )=SD(θ ̂ ) • RMS Error (RMSE): √(E{(θ ̂−θ)^2 } )=√((bias)2+(SE)2 )\nAssume X_1,X_2,X_3,…,X_n are iid with mean μ and SD σ. • Mean of X ̅=E(X ̅ )=μ • Bias = E(X ̅ )−μ=0 • SE of X ̅=SD(X ̅ )=σ/(√n) • RMSE of X ̅=√((bias)2+(SE)2 )=(σ )/(√n)\nIf the population is normally distributed If X_1,X_2,X_3,…,X_n are iid, the population is Normal(μ,σ), then the distribution of sample mean would be X ̅~Normal(μ,σ/(√n))\nCentral Limit Theorem: If X_1,X_2,X_3,…,X_n are iid with mean μ and SD σ, and the sample size is large, then the distribution of sample mean would be X ̅~Normal(μ,σ/(√n))\nThe Sample SD S=√((∑(X_i−X ̅ )^2)/(n−1))\nIf {X_i} are iid, with mean μ and SD σ, then • E(S^2 )=σ^2 • E{(n−1)/n S^2 }=(n−1)/n σ2&lt;σ2 In other words… • Bias(S^2 )=0 • Bias((n−1)/n S^2 )=(n−1)/n σ2−σ2=−1/n σ^2\nThe Distribution of the Sample SD If X_1,X_2,X_3,…,X_n are iid Normal(μ,σ), then the sample SD S satisfies ((n−1) S2)/σ2 ~X_(n−1)^2 • Note: n-1 degree of freedom (df)\nRecap: Sample Mean If X_1,…,X_n have mean μ and SD σ, then • E(X ̅ )=μ nomatter what • SD(X ̅ )=σ/(√n) if the X’s are independent\nIf X_1,…,X_n are iid normal (mean = μ, SD = σ), then X ̅~Normal(mean= μ, SD=σ/(√n))\nIf X_1,…,X_n are iid with mean μ and SD σ and the sample size n is large, then X ̅~Normal(mean= μ, SD=σ/(√n))\nWhat is Confidence Interval (CI)? If X_1,…,X_n are iid normal (mean = μ, SD = σ), and σ is known. X ̅ ~ Normal(mean= μ, SD=σ/(√n)) - we know σ but not μ.

    "text": "✎1774 \n   ♥\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21年给妹写的信，祝贺她考上高中。放在这里是因为忽然发现高中生活已经离我很远、很远了。\n\n\n\n亲爱的妞妞：\n生日快乐！祝贺你考上目标高中！\n本来起草了一篇万字长信，后来一想，没有什么比生日时候收到一封啰啰嗦嗦自鸣得意的说教更扫兴了。于是我把想说的话浓缩成三点：\n\n高中不仅仅是为高考做准备，打开视野，独立思考，尽情享受你的高中生活吧！\n我的语文老师曾说，应试教育是手段，不是目的。鲜活的年轻生命都受不了枷锁，但带着镣铐努力跳完这一段舞，你能看到更广阔的天地。\n心理健康很重要！必要时请向他人寻求帮助。\n\n最后，再次祝你生日快乐！\n渡鸦\nP.S. 礼物说明\n六月底的时候你说想要DND桌游，可惜我暂时没找到正版的，于是送你一套跑团骰子。常言道，扔骰子的意义在于你把它往天上一抛，就知道自己到底想选什么了！\n还有一本是《房思琪的初恋乐园》，不知道你有没有看过。性犯罪比我们想象中的更频繁，千万警惕可能的骚扰行为！\n\n\n\n那篇啰啰嗦嗦自鸣得意的说教\n\n亲爱的妞妞：\n15岁生日快乐！恭喜你升入理想的高中！\n本来想写一篇万字长信，但回头一想，自己如果在生日当天收到一封洋洋自得的所谓“经验总结”，说不定白眼都要翻到天上去。不过分享欲是抑制不住的，如果你有兴趣的话烦请继续看下去啦！\n我的母校XX中学以放浪不羁的校风闻名。受此影响，我认为高中的意义不仅仅是为高考厉兵秣马，更重要的是打开视野，审视自己，学会独立思考，为独立面对社会打下基础。即使不谈这些久远的意义，就谈高中，永远指望着抽象的目标奋斗也是不现实的。尤其是高三的时候，每天的重复劳动会让人怀疑人生，这时候抬头看看窗外像鸽子一样立在枝头的玉兰花，就觉得自己不仅仅是一台答题机器，而是站在这片土地上的一个人。\n不过，既然选择了高考的道路，应试教育便是逃不过的话题。这一点上我并不是专家：我一直是兴趣驱动型的人，纯粹的奋斗不能让我感到快乐——上述的语文老师经常吼我“渡鸦，醒醒！”我能提供的有限经验和教训如下（应该也是老生常谈了）：首先，不要放弃任何一个知识点，尤其是理科，以后补起来得从地基开始补。老师脾气暴躁、阴阳怪气都不重要，不懂就问，不要因为和老师赌气就放弃自己的分数。然后，练习真的有用。高中知识都不会特别难，本质就是刷分，沉住气去练基本上都能练会。最后，成绩波动非常正常。我本人位比有从19%跳水到91%过，物理全卷只做对了三道题，数学十道填空错八道，都熬下来了，顶多关在厕所哭一会儿，找心理老师聊一会儿。\n高中在我心里的另一个意义就是同学情谊。很幸运，我的班级氛围很好，我在这里认识了很铁有趣的朋友和许多非常欣赏的人，每天上课下课叽叽喳喳从火影忍者聊到感受态细菌和电磁场最后一大题，很开心。至于感情——我不知道你是不是这么想的，但我进高中时定下的目标就是：“要有最好的朋友，要有喜欢的人，要有爱好的学科和理想。”其他愿望基本实现，只有喜欢的人这一点以比较悲剧的方式结尾；教训是，如果感情强烈到了伤害自己的地步，最好找个人倾诉一番。无论如何，不要鄙视自己的感情；荷尔蒙会和青春年华一起在几年内迅速褪去，一切经历都是值得珍视的。\n啰嗦到这里，我单独提一下老师。好老师对人的正面影响有多大不必多说。但也有素质不行的老师，从上课一直阴阳怪气贬低学生，到直接上手打上脚踢的都有。这时候不要怕，要知道他才是那个仗着一点权力就胡天胡地的垃圾，自己并不是犯错的那个；必要的情况可以寻求校方或者家长的帮助。并非不信任你的心理素质，只是我的一个高中同学被数学老师贬低到崩溃退学了，非常可惜。一定不能让自己的人生毁在这种人身上。关于性犯罪方面的问题，请参照生日礼物之一《房思琪的初恋乐园》（或许你已经看过）。\n最后，再次祝你生日快乐！六月底的时候你说想要DND桌游，可惜我暂时没找到正版的，于是送你一套跑团骰子，以后遇到什么无法解决的难题，捏住两枚一扔就知道该选什么了～\n送上我最喜欢的女诗人茨维塔耶娃诗一首：\n\n“很快从燕子——变成女巫！ 青春！我们马上将告别…… 让我与你在风中小站片刻！ 我黝黑的青春！请安慰你的姐妹！\n让紫红的裙子像火苗一般闪烁， 我的青春！我肤色黝黑的 小鸽子！我的灵魂的碎片！ 我的青春！安慰我，跳舞吧！\n挥舞着天蓝色的纱巾， 喜怒无常的青春！我俩 尽情儿玩耍！跳吧，跳得热火朝天！ 别了，我金色的青春，琥珀的青春！\n我不无用意地握起你的双手， 像告别情人一般与你告别。 从内心深处迸发出来的青春—— 我的青春！走吧，去找别人！ ”\n\n渡鸦\n\n\n\n\n  Kudos ♥\n\n\n\n© 2024-2026 RavensNest.",

    "text": "✎2431 \n   ♥\n\n\n这是我在看完RIDE/The Charlatans的Between Nowhere Tour以后在狂热状态下写的日记。\n现在回想起来，那种快乐到眩晕的状态可能一辈子都不会再体验到了。因为疫情原因，在这场演出以前，我只看过校园乐队的小演出和没什么感觉的大团的arena演出。这是我第一次在这么近、这么小的场馆里看到水平很棒的、我很喜欢的乐队演出，身边还有亲密的朋友；RIDE的四个人带着他们的爆裂音响就这样杵在我面前，简直是根本不够看。第一次看到吉他手离我这么近地表演solo，那冲击力真是不一般。喝酒也没有经验，狂灌了一整瓶。费城Union Transfer的音量是我去过的场馆里最响的，当时我又不知道要戴耳塞，最后耳鸣了一晚上，然后拖着这个破听力和朋友躺在床上不停地反刍。那天还在下雪，当时我还是那种刚搬到北方的南方人，看到雪地还会兴奋，还没有开始讨厌冬天。\n以后去看多著名的乐队或许都不会有这种感觉了，因为只属于我的蒙娜丽莎我早已遇见……\n\n回巴尔的摩的火车真是太晃了。\n度过了一个非常不错的周末！周五中午开完组会后和Ⰶ去学校里玩雪，玩了一个小时，然后乘Amtrak去了费城，在♫家和𓃝以及♫的室友一起吃了晚饭，她们做了腊肠饭，牛仔骨和虾饺，每个都好吃得离谱，非常满足。\n18:45我们打车去了Union Transfer。整个下午我一直非常担心演出被取消，因为美国东北部在下暴风雪，我们大学的官方活动都被取消了。到达目的地以后，等的人已经在门口排成了一条长队，我就安心太多了，并且也很开心这么多人愿意提早一个小时过来。我们过了安检，买了酒，然后就跑到前排去等着了，心情简直就是飘飘欲仙的激动。\n\n\n\n\n\nUnion Transfer平面图\n\n\nThe Charlatans的部分我迅速带过。他们的主唱Tim Burgess巨会营业：当你还在为“我不是单纯来朝圣的，有5%的我是想在演出结束后发Instagram”而感到愧疚时，Tim已经在演出中间掏出手机号召大家挥手蹦迪，然后把手机倒过来拍自己了，网感未免有点太好。\n中场休息时酒瓶已空。舞台的灯光是绿色的，我们站在第三排左侧的位置等着巡演工作人员把设备调好。我和朋友开玩笑说，待会儿可能就没有这么多营业了，因为Mark和Andy都有吉他在手上，腾不出手来指挥蹦迪。最先搬上来的是写着RIDE的底鼓，然后是三个效果器板，Steve的在左边，中间是Mark的，右边是Andy的。虽然完全不懂单块，一种强烈的瘙痒的冲动还是让我踮着脚努力去看板上到底有什么。伟大的建筑一般的电路系统啊。Mark有一个红色的块，上面的两行光点不停的来回闪动。吉他也搬出来了，两把Rickenbacker，一把樱桃红的，一把红色的；两把Gretsch，一把红的(其实是Trini Lopez)，一把原木色的。这时，音响里切到了Blur的The Narcissist。我忽然感觉这是我在The Ballad of Darren发行半年后第一次真正与这首歌共情。与朋友们微醺地站在台下等着喜爱的乐队上台的感觉如此之好，人生能有几次这样的经历呀？之前一直吐槽这首歌是Damon Albarn年近60终于把抑郁症治好了，现在只觉得幸福。可能是疫情的原因吧，身边的联系都显得愈发珍贵起来。\n\n\n\n\n\n对耳膜宝具！\n\n\n接着，灯光渐暗，音乐变成低沉而逐渐加快的鼓点。后台的灯光亮了起来，观众席里的嘈杂声落了下来，最后变成一阵阵的欢呼和尖叫。乐队成员上台了，我一边狂跳一边举着一个Love from China的牌牌，Mark问：大家好吗？准备好了吗？那就开始吧。\nSeagull，狂风暴雨一般的嘶鸣声；Kaleidoscope，脑浆跟着吉他一起旋转；In a different place, 灯光似乎和音乐一起升腾；Polar bear, “如果云会唱歌，那就这就是它的声音”……\nDreams burn down开始之前，Mark逗观众一定要报出歌名才演，还一再嫌大家喊得不够响，一直努力保持矜持的我便再也无法忍受，发出了尖锐的爆鸣声。Loz的鼓太帅了。每一首歌都很完美。做实验的时候听的音乐，冬季闲逛看海时听的音乐，现在就在离我如此之近的舞台上，以这样暴力、直白、美丽的方式爆炸，震碎我的鼓膜直达灵魂。Vapour trail的前奏响起的时候我没有录像，而是百分百地投入合唱。音量如此之响，我基本聋了，听到Andy的声音是完全变形了的，但还是很开心。清新的旋律和单纯美丽的歌词，就像第一次点开Nowhere的那一刻一般，就像初恋一般。Tim给Here and Now合了口琴，我从未意识到口琴可以拥有这样近乎暴力的美感。然后是Nowhere, Lannoy Point, Monaco和新歌Peace Sign。前排的姐姐们应该是铁粉，在Peace Sign的副歌特别给面子地举起双手，比出“耶”的手势应援。收尾曲是Leave Them All Behind。前奏那段采样出来的时候我真的要哭了。Mark喝了一口他那蜂蜜威士忌，Andy看着笑一笑，Steve铺垫着前奏，然后两把Gretsch一起加进来。天呐，我离得那么近，近得可以看到每一个和弦变换和每一个推弦；所有的声音以一种迷幻又充满力量的方式在我脑后一块酸涩的区域混合起来。I don’t care about the colors, I don’t care about the light, I don’t care about the truth… 然后是吉他独奏——主旋律的变奏加上哇音踏板，音符跟着鼓点迸发出来，如此明亮，仿佛鸟儿沐浴着晨光从混沌的黑暗中挣扎而出。最后的outro是一浪高过一浪的音墙，就像刹车失效的公路旅行和不会有终点的逃亡……\n接着魔法师停下了魔咒。Andy说，谢谢，希望我们能很快再见。 Loz给大家拍了照，我们在上面。\n再接着就是长长的、似乎永远都不会结束的后劲。乘着这份飘飘欲仙的心情，我花了35刀买了丑丑的巡演T恤，在Union Transfer “sold out”的告示牌前面拍了照，在回♫家的出租车上跟着广播哼starman，最后变成大合唱；第二天幸福而无所顾忌地倒在费城美术馆前洁白松软的积雪上。\n回到巴尔的摩后，真的感觉有变得更加热爱生活。我对♫说想把这一刻的幸福全部榨出来，风干储存，这样每次想回忆的时候就能掏出来看看，就又有力量可以继续生活了。我真的可以如此贪心吗？但至少到星期三的现在，坐在实验室的椅子上写这篇日记时，那种不可思议的快乐的心情依然存在。Maybe it’s really, really, really can happen!\n再也吹不出那样的彩虹屁，看了也会红着脸躲避\n\n\n\n  Kudos ♥\n\n\n\n© 2024-2026 RavensNest.",

And there was no preconception of what to do.’\n年轻人的第一张电子乐专辑！Get Lucky是很久之前玩明日方舟的时候就听过的歌（因为游戏内致敬了）。Instant Crush是和The Strokes的主唱Julian Casablancas合作的，听了一遍立刻就喜欢上了。\n推荐曲目：Giorgio by Moroder/Instant Crush/Get Lucky\n\n\nGalaxie 500 - The Portable\n\n\n\n‘The heat is just delicious’\n是合集，绿色的封面设计好美。Don’t Let Our Youth Go to Waste是翻唱曲，但感觉Galaxie 500的翻唱曲都有自己独有的味道。Dean在后来的乐队Luna里翻唱的Indian Summer和Ride Into the Sun也都好好听。\n推荐曲目：Blue Thunder (w/ Sax)/Listen, the Snow is Falling/Don’t Let Our Youth Go to Waste\n在此之外还要加一首NGHFB的Council Skies… 刚因为Fuji Rock的宣传片喜欢上这首歌两天，绿洲就重组了！然后高飞鸟就没了！简直不可原谅！！",

Remember to bring your binoculars since there’s a sign saying ‘birds only beyond this point’ - you would not be able to get too close to that rock. The volunteer is very friendly and helpful, and tide pools are also great fun to explore. Also, if you reside in Portland, be sure to check out Powell’s books, it has a great collection of field guides as well as other gems.\nLinks: Friends of Haystack Rock check the webcams | U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service: Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge | ebird\n\n\n\n\nChina\n\nSuzhou, CN: Huqiu Wetland Park 虎丘湿地生态公园\n\n\n\n\n\nHuqiu Wetland Park during the ‘Plum Rain’ Season, June 2025\n\n\n\nType: Rural | Freshwater; Pond, Forest, Wetland\nFirst Visited: June 2025\nLast Visited: Jul 2025\nBirds: Black-crowned Night Heron, Little Grebe, Azure-winged Magpie, Light-vented Bulbul, Little Egret, Red-rumped Swallow, Pheasant-tailed Jacana, Red-billed Starling, Eurasian Moorhen, Chinese Blackbird, Oriental Magpie-Robin\nComments: My hometown.

The Earth spins and my head spins me back ‘round to you’\n前奏是非常清新帅气的扫弦。听了就开心。\nLeave Them All Behind\n‘Colors shining clear, fading into night. Our grasp is broken, there’s nothing we can do…’\n经典曲目，悬浮于宇宙中一般的体验。现场版非常精彩。\nOX4\n‘Never been so far away, I don’t think I want to stay in this room anymore’\n想家了。\n\n\n\n\n240117\nThe Stone Roses\n\n简评: 来自英国曼彻斯特的摇滚乐队石玫瑰，网友们最爱的夏日乐队。主唱Ian的声音像是浮在现实之外，介于呓语和梦话之间。旋转漂浮的riff营造出轻松迷幻的氛围，像嗑了某种让人欣快的药物一样，感觉骨头里的重量被空气一点点吸走，大脑沉浸在一种糖果色的半透明气泡里。\n\n\n推荐曲目\nSally Cinnamon\n‘Sent to me from heaven, Sally Cinnamon, you’re my world.’\n美好轻盈得不似真实。女孩给女孩写的情书。我为了这个去买了一支肉桂色的口红。\nFool’s Gold\n‘I’m no clown, I won’t back down, I don’t need to let you tell me what’s going down’\n四块二的哇音效果器征服所有人。真是骚爆了，所有的配器都是。站在排练室里会有多爽我都不敢想！\n\n\n四块二的吉他\n萨莉肉桂真好听，虽然也不知道这个神秘的魅力到底在哪里。简简单单的但就是没道理地好听。四块二也没有炫技，但简单的节奏/弹法上的变化就让整首歌变得很精巧很可爱。几条riff的制音/不制音的变化非常灵动，特别喜欢。我觉得这首歌有些音的粘滞感其实不是加了delay而是手留在弦上的时间特别长，他真的很会弹。\n感觉石玫瑰的歌的技巧不在酷炫的长段推揉弦solo上，而是那种变化多端的感觉…比如fool’s gold里面鼓贝斯和吉他都非常，轻松？轻盈？现实逐渐远去，而我升入浅紫色的蒸汽中。并且我觉得四块二的riff有一种特殊的气质，就挺艺术的。某种特别的调式或者不太常见的音程吗？最后制作出来的歌又非常悦耳。是个很懂得怎么运用自己擅长的技巧的乐队（与完全以野性为基础的那些相对）。\n\n\n\n\n240124\nCarnival of Light - Ride\n\n推荐曲目\nBirdman\n‘Blackbird flying in the sky / Please don’t look me in the eye / You are very very lucky / It’s never easy to find me’\n忧郁的曲子。怀揣着命运悲剧的必然，对爱人小心翼翼的无望告白。典型的Andy式纯情歌词。\n1000 Miles\n‘For always and ever it’s getting better / I feel your steps with mine / I’m moving on like it said in the letter / Another place, another time’\n吉他很美很温柔。Mark说这是一首关于’being far away from sth you don’t want to be far away from’的歌。\n\n\n简评+延伸阅读\n这周继续推荐我们的老朋友Ride。这次是收录在三专Carnival of Light里的曲子birdman和1000 miles。请允许博主沉浸在ride-mania里直接给上满分吧（是不是取消评分环节比较好？每次我想推荐曲子的时候，我都想给满分）。\n\nAndy Bell给吉他手的五个小建议 Ride’s Andy Bell: my top 5 tips for guitarists 提到了birdman是特殊调弦，高音E→D。希望有一天我的技术能达到开始应用这些小技巧的程度。\nRide的94年Glastonbury现场 开场曲是birdman，第三曲是1000 miles，最后一曲是mouse trap。现在都是很喜欢的曲子，但第一次看这个视频的时候眼睛里只有这个金毛粉墨镜的骚包造型…哥你当时到底在想什么…\nBirdman的TOTP 这个粉墨镜是94年的必备造型吗哈哈。\n\n\n\n\n\n240131\nThe Smiths\n\n简评:充满罪恶感的一期。这次推荐的是活跃于80年代的曼彻斯特乐队The Smiths。开始听的原因是Ride的吉他手Andy Bell早年的吉他英雄是The Smiths的吉他手Johnny Marr。结果发现是个顾影自怜的社恐（文艺青年，loser，随便怎么说吧）——也就是我——会相当喜欢的乐队……你在生活中发的每一个牢骚都能找到一首对应的歌。 主唱Steven Morrissey很会写歌词，如诗一般，坦白而优美。虽然通过咀嚼自己的忧郁来获得快乐是一种罪恶，但今天就放纵一下吧。\n\n\n推荐曲目\nThere is a Light that Never Goes Out - The Queen Is Dead (1986)\n‘And if a double-decker bus crashes into us / to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die / If a ten-tonne truck kills the both of us / to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine’\n和人乘车兜风的时候有没有想过“就是死在这一刻我也愿意”？请听这首。目前是我最喜欢的一首。\nHow Soon Is Now? - Hatful of Hollow (1984)\n‘You shut your mouth, how can you say / I go about things the wrong way? / I am human and I need to be loved / Just like everybody else does’\n感觉自己被全世界伤害抛弃了？请听这首（会让你陷入更深的抑郁和相伴相随的顾影自怜中）。乐器非常美。\nStill Ill - The Smiths (1984)\n‘I decree today that life is simply taking and not giving / England is mine / it owes me a living / but ask me why I’ll spit in your eye’\n感觉被整个时代辜负了？请听这首。\nI Know It’s Over - The Queen Is Dead (1986)\n‘If you’re so funny, then why are you on your own tonight / And if you’re so slever, then why are you own tonight / If you’re so very entertaining, then why are you on your own tonight / if you’re so very good-looking, then why are you on your own tonight’\n被甩了，想被再骂几句？请听这首。\nHeaven Knows I’m Miserable Now - Hatful of Hollow (1984)\n’I was looking for a job and then I found a job / And heaven knows I’m miserable now / In my life, why do I give valuable time / To people who don’t care if I live or die?’\n明明只是在过日常的生活，甚至过得也挺开心的，但你敏感的内心就是填满了忧郁？请听这首。\nPanic - The World Won’t Listen (1987)\n‘Burn down the disco / Hang the blessed DJ / Because the music that they constantly play / It says nothing to me about my life’\n被酒吧的狗屎音乐毁了你一天的心情（心情居然可以变得比白天更糟糕吗）？请听这首。\nThis Charming Man - The Smiths (1984)\n‘I would go out tonight but I haven’t got a stitch to wear / This man said, It’s gruesome that someone so handsome should care’\n如同言情小说一般的homoerotic情节。这首歌让我明白Johnny Marr为什么是Andy的吉他英雄了，相当美丽的吉他（同时也是相当美丽的吉他手）。\n\n\n\n\n240211\nThe White Album/Revolver - The Beatles\n\n简评: 这周其实同时在沉迷白专和revolver。因为某些原因听披头士都是因为“别人的推荐”呢…白专的每首歌都会让我想起同一个人。Revolver是因为seagull的贝斯和taxman很像所以去听的。 今天有点词穷，就不写长长的推荐语了。\n\n\n推荐曲目\nHappiness is a Warm Gun - The White Album\n‘When I hold you in my arms / and I feel my finger on your trigger / I know nobody can do me no harm / because happiness is a warm gun, mama’\n对“死亡的欲望”最好的诠释。列侬作为vocalist的表现力体现得淋漓尽致。\nBlackbird - The White Album\n‘Blackbird singing in the dead of night / take these broken wings and learn to fly’\n很美丽的一首歌，小鸟歌唱。\nJulia - The White Album\n‘Half of what I say is meaningless / But I say it just to reach you, Julia’\n很安静的一首歌。\nWhile My Guitar Gently Weeps - The White Album\n‘I look at the world and I notice it’s turning / while my guitar gently weeps’\n轻轻哭泣的吉他。\nHere, There and Everywhere - Revolver\n‘Here, making each day of the year / changing my life with a wave of her hand / nobody can deny that there’s something there’\n非常美丽的一首情歌。\nTaxman - Revolver\n非常酷的贝斯线。\nTomorrow Never Knows - Revolver\n非常前卫且酷炫的编曲和配器和一切。\n\n\n\n\n240219\nThe Velvet Underground & Nico\n\n简评:又是听经典专辑的一周。直到今天才终于get到了所有摇滚爱好者都爱不释手的大香蕉…因为是一边做实验一边摸鱼写的，就不啰里八嗦地吹彩虹屁了。又有抒情的美丽小曲又有很实验的曲子的一张超棒的专辑。总之请听！每一首曲子都很值得认真听。\n\n\n推荐曲目\nSunday Morning\n‘Watch out / The world’s behind you’\n前奏由梦幻的玩具钢琴弹奏。\nVenus in Furs\n‘Kiss the boot of shiny, shiny leather / Shiny leather in the dark’\n很有意思的乐器弹奏方式。\nI’ll Be Your Mirror\n‘I’ll be the wind, the rain and sunset / the light on your door to show that you’re home’\n儿歌般的风格。纯美小歌一首。\nHeroin\n‘And I guess that I just don’t know’\n模拟吸毒？让温暖欣快的旋律和鼓点把你带入这种特殊的氛围中吧。\n\n\n\n\n240227\nLoveless - my bloody valentine\n\n简评: 忙得脚不着地的一周，推荐语就摸鱼了。经典盯鞋专辑，mbv的巅峰之作。让人联想到温暖的原始海洋、菌毯和虫群、最本能的冲动、与爱无关的繁殖欲望。\n\n\n推荐曲目\n从头听到尾。\n\n\n\n\n240310\nVanishing Point - Primal Scream\n\n简评: 忙得脚不着地的一周，推荐语就摸鱼了——我应该会继续用这个简评直到下周春假开始前。很有意思的专辑，风格很多样。最近在看ride成员的新访谈，总是在说“比起老音乐我们要听更多新音乐”。但对我来说这些90-00S音乐也是新音乐啦。话说这张专辑其实是我在discogs的一家indie/rock唱片店里乱逛的时候撞见的。爱我就帮我买smile EP（玩笑\n\n\n推荐曲目\n暂无。\nTrainspotting电影的同名主题曲也收录在这里哦。\n\n\n\n\n240314\nTepid Peppermint Wonderland - the Brian Jonestown Massacre\n如果有人还在关注这个专栏的话，请都去看DIG!好么。算我求你。\nBV号附：BV1m64y1s7Pi\n\n简评: 大名鼎鼎（或许并不）的90S美国西海岸neo-psychedelia乐队，布莱恩琼斯镇大屠杀。专制、高产、才华横溢到恐怖的主唱Anton Newcombe。总之用这些关键字去微博和豆瓣上搜的话都能搜到BJM粉丝们分享的趣闻…… 八卦放在一边。Tepid Peppermint Wonderland应该是收录得相当完全的一张精选辑了。越听越爱。\n\n\n推荐曲目\nSwallowtail (live)\n好美的一首盯，吉他从清音切到失真solo的那一段我真的是爱死了。\n\n\n\n\n240324\nyou made me realise - my bloody valentine\n\n简评: 这周还是继续盯。大名鼎鼎的mbv噪音大屠杀，you made me realise！对不起我简介又偷懒了。\n\n\n推荐曲目\n除了you made me realise以外剩下的几首也都很有意思！我其实一直get不到isn’t anything里Kevin的vocal，在这张里终于get到了。\nyou made me realise 13年的一个现场：\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXlrMQO3AFA\n\n\n题外话\n最近看了不少挺有意思的mbv采访，顺便贴在下面吧。\n尤其推荐第一篇，我觉得Kevin Shields是个相当有意思的吉他手（除开他那令人无法忍受的拖延症不谈）。这一篇相当地有启发性，谈到了音乐（或者说声音）的一些本质特征是为何会让人觉得有新鲜感/有安全感。\n最后两篇访谈分别来自Bilinda和Debbie。\n\nKevin Shields: Fender were the first brand to ever really ask me to do a signature pedal\nClassic Tracks: My Bloody Valentine ‘Only Shallow’\nView topic - rare insight into mbv via bilinda butcher interview 2008\nMy Bloody Valentine - Creation Records\n\n\n\n\n\n240401\nEVOL - Sonic Youth\n\n简评: 在罪恶地沉迷老男人新发的专辑aka Interplay一个周末后决定去听听我的噪音初恋洗洗耳朵…… 个人感觉EVOL是SY早期三部曲（EVOL, sister, daydream nation）里最好的一张。整张专辑的气质像青铜塑成的野兽之眼，粗糙、锋利、危险的同时又很美。颤抖的不和谐音镶嵌在清冽干燥的大调五声音阶中，Lee和Thurston的吉他相互挑逗，请听吧会爱上的。\n\n\n推荐曲目\nShadow of a Doubt\nKim颤抖的倾诉。从精致的分解和弦过渡到震颤的音墙，最后堙灭在又一段分解和弦里，非常轻盈、非常牡丹亭。\nMadonna, Sean, and Me (Expressway to Yr Skull)\n不和谐音+大调音阶的完美例子，Thurston的vocal在这首歌里好美。\nTom Violence\n青涩的暴力冲动。\nIn the Kingdom #19\nPatti Smith式的念白配上赛车一般的吉他嘶鸣声。\nStarpower\n典型的让人头晕目眩的Kim式性感。\n\n\n\n\n240417\nTurns Into Stone - The Stone Roses\n\n简评: 我又回来了！这周推荐石玫瑰的B面曲集合：Turns Into Stone。不想打推荐语了，这么热的天，不听石玫瑰听什么呢？并且终于又到了一个我愿意把歌词quote上的乐队…其他乐队的作词水平只能说是聊胜于无。\n\n\n推荐曲目\nMersey Paradise\n‘You see it in the sea / River cool’s where I belong / In my Mersey paradise’\nGoing Down\n‘To look down from the clouds you don’t need to fly / I’ve never flown in a plane / I’ll live until I die’\n\n\n\n\n240422\nOshin - DIIV\n\n简评: DIIV的新专要上了。上周把他们之前的所有专都听了一遍，感想是听到就是赚到。\n\n\n推荐曲目\n今天忙得要死不想写了，但整张都是完美的，印象很深刻的有Human和Air Conditioning。\n\n\n\n\n240526\nMrs. Dolphin - Pale Saints\n\n简评: 隔了这么久才写下一篇，结果DIIV的新专真的上了哈哈哈。七月份去看现场！其实比起Oshin我更喜欢is the is are。 其实好几周前就在听pale saints了，喜欢得不得了。比起著名的The Comforts of the Madness，我更喜欢这张EP合集。简单纯粹又带着些微的黑暗和阴郁，世界上最美丽的独立音乐…用最单纯的旋律唱着“I wish him dead”这样的歌词… 题外话这张专的CD好稀有噢，好想要但是二手碟都卖好贵。4AD快点给我再版看看实力。\n\n\n推荐曲目\nSight of You\nColours and Shapes\nHalf Life, Remembered\n\n\n\n\n240618\nPenthouse - Luna\n\n简评: “不能再沉迷英国乐队了！”抱着这样的心情在discogs上赛博逛街的时候翻到的，Galaxie 500的主脑Dean Wareham在前者解散后新组的乐队。Penthouse是一张让人想起纽约的专辑。很浪漫，像带了点爵士和梦幻风格的velvet underground。整张都很好听。Galaxie 500的歌我也去听了——On Fire很美丽（有翻唱New Order的Ceremony）。\n\n\n推荐曲目\n23 Minutes in Brussels\nChinatown\nLost in Space\n\n\n\n\n  Kudos ♥\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024-2026 RavensNest.",

    "section": "观后感",
    "text": "观后感\n\n第一集：爱与权力 Love & Power\n这一集讲述的是上世纪颇有影响力的哲学家Ayn Rand，和新自由主义/加州精英主义（相信只要所有人都能做到极度的理性/自私——和电脑一样理性/自私——就可以创造一个全新的、民主的平衡世界）之间的关系。导演试图说明这个电脑+Ayn Rand创造的“人们可以通过个人主义和理性主义来调控世界的乌托邦”是不存在的——聚集在Ayn周围的小群体因为Ayn与其中一位成员的关系而终结了；而在更大的尺度上，这种蔓延至美国领导层的坚信导致了97年左右的亚洲金融危机和09年左右的世界金融危机。\n我觉得这一集的联系有点牵强，或者说偏执。很不喜欢的一点是把Ayn的陨落简单地归于爱情的失败，用一种“爱情一定是非理性的”的态度来攻击她的理性主义。是不是有点太狡猾了呢？看到女人就觉得爱情一定是最终把她击败的困境。我总觉得攻击一个哲学家应该用另一套哲学理论来攻击，而不是用“她没能践行她的哲学”来攻击，这样的话可以攻击的哲学家多了去了。\n\n\n第二集: 群落概念的滥用 The Use and Abuse of Vegetational Concepts\n这一集讲述的是“世界是一个趋向于平衡（equilibrium）的系统”这个概念是如何被发明和滥用的。生态系统是一个稳定的系统。很熟悉吧？大家都是这么想的。但追溯历史的脉络，这个概念其实并未经过严谨的科学验证；它其实是早期的生态学家出于对电脑模型的痴迷、以及一种古老的哲学执念而创造的一个过于简化的模型。这个概念被发明的五十年后，新一代的生态学家已经用数据、实验和建模将其驳倒了。可惜的是，这个概念已经深深地潜入了大众心中。这导致了两个后果：一，大家过于相信“人可以通过点对点的连接组成一个能自我平衡的系统，不需要任何权威/权力结构的维持”，却不知它是不可能长久的。这部分有提到美国70年代嬉皮士们失败的family commune尝试（即他们重新发现了“利维坦”——无组织终将导向混乱，所以每个人必须上交权力给暴力机构以维持必要的稳定状态），21世纪通过互联网连结而发动的没有领导者的革命，等等。 二，政治家滥用这个概念用于维护统治者的权威。“世界是一个平衡的系统，所以政治家要做的仅仅是维持目前的状态”，这种观念让启蒙年代的进步主义消失了，取而代之的是一种不知道该如何前进的虚无。\n这是我最喜欢的一集，可能因为和我的专业知识联系比较紧密吧。我自己也常年处于一种虚无主义漩涡中，被这么激一下也挺好的。\n\n\n第三集: 机器中的猴子，猴子中的机器 The Monkey in the Machine and the Machine in the Monkey\n这一集讲述的是“自私的基因”，上世纪白人精英改变世界的梦想，那位研究山地大猩猩的科学家Fossey，电脑的发明，以及刚果内战之间的联系。“自私的基因”是这样的一套理论：人类的行为，无论是好的还是坏的，实际上都是由存在于我们之上的机器——即我们的DNA组成的巨大计算系统——所控制的，并且一切都为且仅为基因的存续而存在。这套极度理性和非人化的理论实际上导致了荒谬且自相矛盾的后果。理论创立者其一Price因为害怕自己理论的结论而成为了基督徒布道者，但这却导致了更多的伤害；另一位创立者Hamilton成为了极端的进化论信奉者——反对现代医学，因为现代医学会让弱者的基因存续下去；Fossey为了大猩猩的福祉恐吓当地居民，最终被杀死在营地里；由比利时自由主义者发起的刚果民主化进程最终导致了惨无人道的刚果内战。总之就是看似科学理性的出发点却导致了很多道德上的灾难。\n这是我感觉最令人震撼的一集。导演把很多略有耳闻的事件相互串联，加上高超的剪辑手法，达到了可以说是mind-blowing的效果。人类的存在真是荒谬啊。\n\n\n整体观感\n导演的剪辑功力非常强，喜欢用庵野秀明式的“为残忍的画面配上纯净的音乐，为美丽的画面配上悬疑的音乐”手法来制造紧张气氛；第三集开头的一段剪辑简直可以称为吗喽罗曼史，非常震撼，猴核爱好者必看。如果我在大一就看了这个我的期末电影作业也不会拿B-了。\n导演喜欢用全知全能的视角在一个小时里串联起几十年间似乎没有关系的一些事件以讲述道理。这个形式震撼力很强，但有时解释不够，反而让人对他试图证明的理论产生些微怀疑。\n价值观上，导演是个进步/启蒙主义复兴者，可适时酌情打上这一剂猛药来应对现代生活中常有的虚无感；但对于一些概念的解释略有点牵强附会。\n绝对不是无聊的片子，质量非常高，强烈推荐。",

    "text": "✎201 \n   ♥\n\n\nThis weekend I visited Eagle Creek Park near Indianapolis with my friends. It’s freezing outside, so we only walked ~10 minutes on the trail, and saw some Canada geese, ducks, gulls, and coots on water from a distance. I could only identify Canada geese by their larger size compared to other birds &gt;_&lt;\nTo my surprise, the Ornithology Center at the Eagle Creek Park is really good. The ornithology center contains a wild birds rescue center (they’ve rescued a turkey vulture, a bald eagle, and a few owls), a little museum (a great collection of books, field guides, specimen, and memes), an indoor observation station facing the lake (helps a lot when it’s freezing outside, and you can borrow binoculars), and a few bird feeders (you can sit on chairs - indoor or outdoor - and watch birds enjoying their time, and don’t worry, there are anti-collision stickers on the windows). On the windows facing the trail, there are great window paintings - I really like the loon window, and hopefully I can see them during the spring/fall migration periods!\nA very dedicated team curated everything. I pay due respect to all people working there, and we had a great time. Definitely want to visit there again in the future when it’s warmer!\nEagle Creek Park eBird Page\n\n\n\n\n\nBald eagle Carson\n\n\n\n\n\nCarson’s story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuseum\n\n\n\n\n\nBooks and other display\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation station\n\n\n\n\n\nWindow painting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCardinal and sparrow at the feeder\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite breasted nuthatch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Kudos ♥\n\n\n\n© 2024-2026 RavensNest.",

    "text": "人在巴尔的摩，线下去哪玩\n\n唱片店\n\n\n冷知识：Record Store Day/唱片店日最初就是在巴尔的摩的Fell’s Point发起的，后来逐渐变成了全球性的纪念日。\n\n\n\nThe Sound Garden, 2024/05\n\n\n\n\n\n内部\n\n\n\n\n\n门外的标识\n\n\n\nThe Sound Garden - Baltimore\n\n号称是全美第二的唱片店（第一是LA的Amoeba Music，我也逛过了，感觉不如此店），我最爱逛的唱片店，位于宁静美丽的Fell’s Point。里面一手二手的黑胶CD一应俱全，可以在大甩卖里捡漏；永远放着很酷的音乐，偶尔会有DJ现场打碟；经常会举办新专辑的listening party；还可以买各种周边产品，包括娅娅蜡烛和魔力吸布贴啥的。总之，氛围一级棒。已经悄无声息地花了很多钱了。\n与此相关的奇遇是，24年10月在DC的The Anthem看JAMC的时候瞥见前面站着的一位女士的手机壳里塞了一张The Sound Garden的贴纸，遂迅速认亲（？）女士就顺势问我，你年纪这么小为什么来看我们80年代的乐队？我只能尴尬回答我有恋老癖哈哈现在中国年轻人就好这一口盯鞋！\n\n\n现场演出\n\nOttobar\n\n位于Charles Village的Ottobar小小的，氛围非常亲切。我在这看了La Luz，基本上就是站在主唱的鞋尖前看的，体验太好了，音效也不炸。\n\nBaltimore Soundstage\n\n位于市中心、比Ottobar大一些的场馆，大概千人级别，很棒，无须多言。在这看了Alcest。\n\nCFG Bank Arena\n\n位于市中心的一般通过arena，the 1975/Charli XCX这种等级的明星在这里演过，但我还是比较偏爱小型场馆。需要注意的是这个场馆旁边就是Howard Street，晚上有很多毒贩，不要单独行动。\n\nThe Lyric\n\n位于Mount Vernon的剧院，魔力吸在这里演过。传说中是为了和JHU医学院在地理上平衡而建的（东巴尔的摩的医学院太重了，得在巴尔的摩西部建一个一样重的大东西才能让地面不翘起来——某位神秘人士曾如此告诉我）…\n\n巴尔的摩另一个很好的第一个地方就是处于美东密集的铁路网之中，所以四舍五入北边的费城（火车1.5小时）和南边的DC（火车1小时）的场馆都算在可达范围内啦！\n\n\n冷知识：美国的第一条铁路就是位于巴尔的摩的B&O Railroad（巴尔的摩-俄亥俄铁路）。这条铁路还有一个博物馆，很有意思的，24年被我们部门租了开retreat。\n关于这条铁路的另一个冷知识是Johns Hopkins（对，就是JHU的创始人）当年也有投资B&O Railroad。\n\nUnion Transfer - Philadelphia, PA\n9:30 Club - Washington D.C.\nThe Anthem - Washington D.C.\nThe Fillmore - Silver Spring, MD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmtrak的火车票价格和机票一样会波动，一般提前一个月左右买最便宜。MARC Train（只能去DC）车票价格不会波动，但每天发车时间不一样，得参考官网。\n需要注意的是Amtrak一般晚上十点后就都没有班次了，所以如果看晚上的演出需要在当地留宿。费城的Apple Hostel不错。第二天早晨五六点会有红眼火车送你回家，努力一点甚至可以赶得上早八。不要问我怎么知道的。\n如果实在想当天往返，还有两个选择：一个是乘Greyhound，DC的Greyhound站一直开到午夜后，但要注意打车去Union Station巨堵无比，车上条件比较艰苦，巴尔的摩的Greyhound站也不在JHU的校车范围内，总之不建议独自行动。另一个是自己租车，除了I-95道路上的大坑让开夜车略微危险以外，没啥问题。\n演出票如果在线下买会比线上买便宜15%左右，因为可以规避Ticketmaster/AXS等购票平台收取的高额服务费。具体怎么买，场馆的官网上一般会写（搜box office就行）。\nStubhub等二手网站购票有一定风险（reddit上都有讨论），个人觉得还是官方渠道买最放心，虽然实际上也买了不少二手票（。",

    "text": "✎888 \n   ♥\n\n\n又是一年青年节。\n我想来点理想主义，想为我的人生和时代找点意义。高中的时候至少有语文课和历史课。学国际史的时候，只要老师还不是行尸走肉，总会好好讲法国大革命，以及前后发生的一切。语文课会讲《人类的群星闪耀时》。上大学前，我曾这么想过：以后每天都要有学习的时间，玩儿的时间，读书的时间，和发呆的时间——现在回想一下，这个想法很美好，但多少有点不贴近实际：一方面，书相比高中时候读得太少了；另一方面是这四件事都非常私人化，接触的人也太少，一直这样下去容易钻牛角尖。\n高中起，我就一直把鲁迅《热风》里那段“如果竟没有炬火，我便是唯一的光”贴在书撑上来激励自己关注现实，但实际执行上却遇到了很多困难。作为一个大学生，我到底能做什么呢？看着社会新闻辗转难眠的夜晚，除了点点屏幕，转发评论以外，似乎什么都做不了；第二天醒来一切都404，什么记录都不会留下。而“在自己的本职上发光发热就好”这种理论，放到现实生活里也就是好好学习好好考试，和高中两耳不闻窗外事的状态也没有什么区别。充斥着现代娱乐的大学生活真的让人好空虚，信息来源增多了理论基础却没跟上，多得是无根浮萍一般的抱怨和口嗨，发泄了一时的情绪却没有任何实际的效用，难道我甘愿就这么烂在现代社会的疮疤里吗。\n上通识课的时候，M在文摘里批判无政府主义，意大利老安那其教授呵呵一笑说你根本不了解无政府主义。其实我自己也经常这样，每天钻牛角尖，但稍微多了解一下就能发现自己以为的死路其实不过是整个路线网中的一条罢了。教授上课明着鄙视DS人，对生物人（我和M和两位友友）没说啥，可能真的还挺喜欢舌灿莲花的M和我。但我想说学基础科学何尝不是一种逃避…至少对我来说是一种逃避。逃避自己身为政治动物的现实。\n思而不学则殆，很简单的道理。我要多读书，不要逃避文科（因为即使学了理还是常常为了社会新闻和哲学问题彻夜难眠），不要逃避思考（即不能放任自己从情绪/立场出发看问题），努力朝着合格的现代公民和靠谱的成年人这个方向迈进。值得欣慰的是，无论如何，这三年来的确成长了很多。虽然也多了许多的困惑，但也是逐渐找到所谓的unknown unknown的过程吧？\n\n\n\n  Kudos ♥\n\n\n\n© 2024-2026 RavensNest.",

    "text": "✎2874 \n   ♥\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n这篇是直接从备忘录里搬过来的，一字未改。虽然很矫情，但是是我的社会化之始，很有纪念意义（？\n\n\n\n\n荚蒾\n\n就很怨恨也很怀念这件事。让我彻底想明白了感情存在的意义和表达的方法，虽然现在实践经验还不多，但总归在思想上打通了它发展的道路。最好笑的是这完全是自己在钻牛角尖把自己给整抑郁了，红莓花你知不知道这件事我都难讲。感情爆炸的结果就是你现在根本不敢讲当时多少东西是真的存在过，多少东西只是我的脑子在现实空间的投射。毕竟人的脑子有多不可靠大家都知道。\n查到俄语原文的红莓花儿是荚蒾。那也是白色的了，当时为什么会用红莓花儿来比喻你呢。\n\n“Милый мой, хороший, догадайся сам”\n\n殚精竭虑地找了个典雅的比喻用来告慰我的初恋，而你的名字就和夏天的风一样，在看到六月白白的栀子花的一瞬间就想到了。还真是好玩的隐喻啊……\n并且我真的是够贱，青春期读的所有悲情爱情小说，弗洛伦蒂诺和费尔明娜（你算什么弗洛伦蒂诺），赫里内勒多和阿玛兰妲（你算什么赫里内勒多），贾宝玉和林黛玉（你算什么贾宝玉，而我又算什么林黛玉）甚至EVA（你也算不上明日香），都用来代红莓花，你给我任何好处了吗？真的是。16岁的我，画一颗甜枣就争着想用你的手扇自己巴掌……无法享受当下相处的任何时光，每一分每一秒都是焦灼，不知道自己想要什么，只知道我对你有强烈的感情，而这种感情即将把我烧死了。唉。而栀子花，你给我的都是鼓励和善良，让我开始反思自己的乖戾和愤世嫉俗是不是理所应当的……你多好。只是站在那里就够了，就能把我从自毁里救出来。所以我一直觉得单恋比起献殷勤，更加是一个对自我的挖掘过程，将对方的优缺点投射在自己身上，在一遍一遍的比较中找出自己需要进步的地方和对方“也不是那么厉害嘛”的地方。所以我本质上不是认为两个人寂寞了就会互相吸引的\n但现在在解构了爱情以后发现实际上也就是两个寂寞的平凡人互相吸引互相告慰罢了。毕竟我也不是阿玛兰妲，也不是费尔明娜。甚至费尔明娜也柴米油盐过了大半辈子呢，最后与弗洛伦蒂诺的结合带来的也不过是垂垂暮年的又几日柴米油盐。但他们能从中感到幸福，或许吧。有的时候裸睡醒来觉得如果我能把整个上半身趴在别人身上就好了，这是一种动物本能的幸福感，猫猫被挠下巴的幸福感。\n人果然还是群居动物。发现那么多人和我一样困在Nihilism里感觉果然好多了（叹\n\n\n发现有人居然不是每天都很忧郁这一点才是令人最惊讶的\n\n或者说我的生命底调就是非常忧郁的。没有接受刺激的时候就很忧郁，也不知道为什么。\n说是敏感的人一般原生家庭不和睦（但实际上黏糊糊），小时候遭到不公平对待（小学时期的确，班里的氛围挺相互猜忌的，在家里也被爷爷骂，不过也不至于），父母离异（并没有），但在这一切的一切发生以前，我妈就说我小时候一被陌生人碰到就哭，宁愿自己呆着也没有和同学厮混翻一起……\n所以这是为什么呢。\n长大以后这种独自相处的时间就变成我逐渐构建起自己忧郁的世界观的时间\n“人生本来就是没有意义的”\n……\n这种忧郁感来自何方……\n其实我觉得百年孤独实在是对我影响非常大的一本书。15岁读的……从此构成了我对爱情、或者说感性世界一切认识的基础\n情欲、爱、孤独\n孤独……\n\n\n为什么说离开荚蒾时的我处在人生中最抑郁的时间\n\n一个是刚上高中，成绩落差很大自尊心破碎而产生的自卑心理（当时被爱情的热血掩盖了，没能及时觉察真正的本质原因），能从日记里一直过于神化你的成就看出来。\n一个是无意义感……因为开始思考人生的意义，下意识觉得追赶别人这一件事已经不能激起我的动力了吧（现在的确，单纯的比较再也支持不了我了，这是翻初中的日记翻到有那么多对竞争对手的痛骂时忽然发现的）。记得当时写，听了职业生涯规划大会，看到玥和她女朋友亲亲热热地一起去打球，感觉做什么都没有意思，做一桶泡面或者做浮萍就此在阳关下烂掉和做高中生的意义并无不同。但是“只要你冲我笑一下，也就有了做数学题的动力。或者只要风油精抹太阳穴就可以了。”当时一直觉得我活下去的原因一个是怕家人伤心，一个是怕痛。实在是不知道奋斗的快感和意义到底是什么、即使是某一个年级位比以及基于此的分解目标，也不明白到底是为了什么……可能就是最后一点自尊心在支着跑下去……所以最后真的在考场上整个人是抽离的\n现阶段坚信的人生意义说是在大学找到的也不为过。所以我是很相信学校提供的“非物质/实用/成绩价值”的……因为如果不彻底想通，人就不会有前进的动力。大学真的能塑造一个人。\n要说高中带给了我什么，主要是温柔和善良。谢谢五班，谢谢世界上最温柔的班主任，还有我的好朋友小王和佳，还有我的栀子花。另外就是加强了一点我本来就有的傲气和忧郁，这个得感谢杭老师，啊对，杭老师还叫我们不要不努力光做梦。\n红莓花，你到底为我的青春做了什么贡献，我也不明白。似乎全部都是负面影响：十六岁开始抑郁差不多一整年、一遇到男的就一惊一乍怕重蹈覆辙不说，现在爱情也变成我能彻底抽离解构的存在了（不过我这个见一个爱一个的性格怪不了你，我从小就这样）。对爱情去神圣化、开始逐渐接受异性的正常存在也是到了大学以后的事……谢谢小W……不过你到底带给了我什么呢。最好的说法是你是我的青春在马尔克斯世界里的投射。或者说你在马尔克斯世界里的投射是我的青春。想不明白。以后每次告诫自己都是“不要暗恋”、“不要stk”、“不要贬低自我价值”、“不要爱上滤镜里的那个人”、“不要被吊桥效应冲昏头脑”……似乎你是彻底的反面范本……现在想起来也没啥好心动的。日本文学男，无聊透了。倒也不是因为你所以不喜欢日本文学的……最早觉得你也不过如此就是因为你喜欢日本文学。\n总之现在我也不恨你了，也没什么好恨的，我不也狠狠在情绪上刺伤过你吗。你也有理由恨我呢。当时多傻，以为只要在对方心里尽可能留下深刻的痕迹就公平了。现在才知道原来对喜欢的人可以很温柔。\n\n\n看了一会儿知乎的心理学矫情小论文\n\n看起来我的确是曾经有过回避型依恋的显著特征，但也明显被治愈了很多，感谢妈咪，感谢朋友们。\n不过那上面也说回避型如果没有经受过重大打击是意识不到自己的思维方式有问题的。唉，红莓花，你可能是我的牺牲品吧，我的高考数学成绩也是我的牺牲品。不过人生有那么长，有那么多条路呢。这么想，用破碎的一年换以后的大半辈子精神世界不再（那么）痛苦，似乎也是一件好事。并且我也没太伤害到你……希望吧。\n也可以说EVA最后大家围成一圈拍手的场景狠狠地治愈了我。就，逃避又有什么错，接纳又有什么错。不开EVA妈妈也会爱你，开EVA不是因为爸爸的要求，而是因为“我想要”保护我爱的人。“我可以呆在这个世界！”\n真不知道自己的心理问题哪儿来的。和小W说我一旦上头就会忍不住把情绪内化为刀狠狠戳自己，搅得自己不得安宁，没法干任何事。小W说她才不会呢。我说可能是因为单恋吧。唉。小W真好。她和栀子花就是两个能指出我“不正常”之处，但在引导上又很细心，共情得也很温柔的人。真好。妈妈有的时候，或者说大多数时候也是很好的。我永远记得因为在初三不能有效安慰小PP而落泪时，妈妈说你其实已经做得很好了。小王自己是母单，没有太大说服力，不过她也能听我说话，不以为我是异类，并且最近明显心理也成长得越来越好了。真好。大家都在长大，长大也不只是坏事。其实SY和XF姐也很好。只是我初中的时候还是太傲……红莓花你真是有好大作用啊！\n不过开口还是很难为情。\n加持良治是所有自以为心理出了问题的矫情女孩的理想完美恋人吧……“人是无法完全理解别人的，甚至能否理解自己都值得怀疑，百分百互相理解是不可能的。不过呢，正因为如此，人们才会努力去了解自己和他人，所以人生才会有乐趣啊”\n同样是无条件的爱，我还是喜欢加持多过渚薰，因为薰像一个天使，像一个神。和加持与美里一样在夏天的出租房里胡天胡地真是我对浪漫的终极想象。\n\n\n\n  Kudos ♥\n\n\n\n© 2024-2026 RavensNest.",

I am a Ph.D. student major in life sciences.\nI enjoy digital painting, reading, birdwatching, and listening to music.\n\n\nMore Fun Facts About Me\n\n+ I like rainy days. +\n+ My favorite Harry Potter character is Sirius Black. +\n+ During primary school my online nickname was ‘Nyan-Nyan Elisa’. +\n\n\n\n\nWhy Blogging\nThis blog started as a class project to build a professional profile. Over time, I decided to make it more personal. Blogging offers a peaceful online experience without big company manipulation - no ads, no infinite scrolling, no censorship. So, what you’ll see here would be a mix of life science-related and more fun/personal posts. You can filter them by tags.\n个人生活/兴趣内容主要用中文写作\n\n\n\nWhy’s it called ‘Raven’s Nest’\n‘Raven’ is my online name, so I adopted it as my logo. Corvids like shiny trinkets, and I think blogging nowadays is like collecting and displaying trinkets online - maybe there are some inherent resemblance?\nWhen I lived in Baltimore, I used to see flocks of crows gathering on trees during colder times at dusk and dawn. Sometimes what you think that are leaves would actually be a flock of birds. I tried to re-create that effect in the homepage XD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024-2026 RavensNest."

    "text": "Introduction\n\nWhy This Project\nI’m interested in the ‘shoegaze’ subgenre of indie rock. This less-known genre, also called ‘the scene that celebrates itself’, rose from the noise pop scene in the late 80s and early 90s, and has regained popularity recently. An article titled ‘The Shoegaze Revival Hit Its Stride in 2023’ (Sherburne 2023) by pitchfork also captures the revival of shoegaze among GenZ populations.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy bloody valentine’s 1988 EP ‘You made me realise’ is a classic shoegaze record.\n\n\nShoegaze is characterized by heavy use of overdriven guitar and various effect pedals with the combination of the ethereal vocals; the lyrics are often regarded as blank, poetic, and sometimes difficult to distinguish from the instruments. So here comes this project for the indieheads - I want to analyze those usually overlooked lyrics, especially from the perspective of sentiment.\nThe bands I want to study are the so-called classic ‘big-three’ of shoegaze: my bloody valentine, Ride, and slowdive. They were all on the independent record label Creation from London, UK, reached their peak in early 90s, disbanded in late 90s due to the fading of the subgenre, and reunited in the 21st century, which make them a perfect fit to study the changes in the lyrics over the years.\n\n\nMy Questions\n\nWhat words frequently appear in their lyrics?\nWhich bands have the longest and shortest lyrics?\nWho is the saddest shoegaze band?\nAre bands trending towards happiness or sadness over time?",

Ride and mbv rely their vocals heavily on harmonies and hummings - and it’s reflected honestly here, while slowdive has the most ‘meaningful’ lyrics among the three. ‘Love’ is the ultimate meaning of rock and roll, and it indeed appears in high frequency in all of their lyrics.\n\n\nWhich bands have the longest and shortest lyrics?\n\n# plotting\nggplot(lyrics_clean, aes(x = Album, y = lyric.length, fill = Artist)) + \n  geom_boxplot(color = 'black') +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = palette) +\n  labs(\n    title = 'Which bands have the Longest/Shortest Lyrics?',\n    caption = 'Boxplot showing the range and median of lyric lengths for each Album.', \n    color = 'Before Reunion?', \n    y = 'Lyric Length (character)'\n  ) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the three bands, Mbv always has the shortest lyrics overall while Ride has the longest. An interesting trend is that while Ride and slowdive have similar lyric length back in the 90s, after reunion, Ride tends to have longer lyrics - and the length increases for each album.\n\n\nWho is the saddest shoegaze band?\nI used afinn from package tidytext for sentiment analysis based on this paper(Koto and Adriani 2015).\n\n# data processing: sentiment 'afinn'\ntoken_count &lt;- token_clean %&gt;%\n  group_by(Artist, Album, Release.Year) %&gt;%\n  count(Word, name = 'Word_count', sort = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\ntoken_afinn &lt;- token_count %&gt;%\n  inner_join(get_sentiments('afinn'), by = c(\"Word\" = \"word\"))\n\nafinn_score_by_artist &lt;- token_afinn %&gt;%\n  group_by(Artist) %&gt;%\n  summarize(avg = round(mean(value), 2)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\nkable(afinn_score_by_artist)\n\n\n\n\nArtist\navg\n\n\n\n\nRide\n-0.06\n\n\nSlowdive\n0.00\n\n\nmy bloody valentine\n-0.11\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the three bands, mbv has the lowest sentiment score, which means it is the saddest shoegaze band (if we only look at the lyrics). All three bands got sentiment scores less than or equal to zero, with slowdive holding the highest score (0.00).\n\nWhat about their greatest hits?\nUsing data from last.fm, we find out that the greatest hits of the three bands are:\n\nwhen you sleep - my bloody valentine (32171 weekly listeners),\nVapour Trail - Ride (1943 weekly listeners), and\nWhen the Sun Hits - Slowdive (53055 weekly listeners).\n\nI’m interested that whether those songs have a happier or sadder vibe compared to their other songs -\n\n# by song\ntoken_count_bysong &lt;- token_clean %&gt;%\n  group_by(Artist, Song.Title) %&gt;%\n  count(Word, name = 'Word_count', sort = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n# give afinn score\ntoken_afinn_bysong &lt;- token_count_bysong %&gt;%\n  inner_join(get_sentiments('afinn'), by = c(\"Word\" = \"word\"))\n\n# clean data set, drop songs with only 1/2 rows\ntoken_afinn_bysong &lt;- token_afinn_bysong %&gt;%\n  group_by(Song.Title) %&gt;%\n  filter(n() &gt; 2) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n# calculate average scores\nafinn_score_all &lt;- token_afinn_bysong %&gt;%\n  group_by(Song.Title, Artist) %&gt;%\n  summarize(avg_song = mean(value))\n\n# look at the greatest hits\nafinn_score_gh &lt;- afinn_score_all %&gt;%\n  filter(Song.Title == 'Vapour Trail' | Song.Title == 'When the Sun Hits' | Song.Title == 'when you sleep')\n\n# combine datasets for plotting\nafinn_score_gh &lt;- inner_join(afinn_score_gh, afinn_score_by_artist, by = c(\"Artist\" = \"Artist\"))\n\n# plot\nggplot(afinn_score_gh, aes(x = Artist)) +\n  geom_point(shape = 16, size = 3, aes(y = afinn_score_gh$avg, color = Artist)) +\n  geom_point(shape = 17, size = 3, aes(y = afinn_score_gh$avg_song, color = \nSong.Title)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = palette) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = 'dashed', color = 'black') +\n  labs(\n    title = 'Who is the Saddest Shoegaze Band?',\n    caption = 'Average sentiment score calculated based on afinn scores.\\n&lt;0: sad/negative, &gt;0: happy/positive.', \n    y = 'Sentiment Score', \n    x = 'Time', \n    color = 'Artist average/\\ngreatest hits'\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMbv has the lowest overall sentiment score. All those songs have a slightly higher sentiment score than their artist’s average scores. People seem to prefer happy songs!\n\n\nSo what are their happiest/saddest songs?\n\nextreme_song &lt;- afinn_score_all %&gt;%\n  group_by(Artist) %&gt;%\n  filter(avg_song == max(avg_song) | avg_song == min(avg_song)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\nsorted_tibble &lt;- extreme_song %&gt;%\n  group_by(Artist) %&gt;%\n  arrange(Artist, avg_song) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\nkable(sorted_tibble)\n\n\n\n\nSong.Title\nArtist\navg_song\n\n\n\n\nI Came to See the Wreck\nRide\n-1.500000\n\n\nOnly Now\nRide\n-1.500000\n\n\nThe Dawn Patrol\nRide\n2.000000\n\n\nThe Sadman\nSlowdive\n-2.333333\n\n\nEveryone Knows\nSlowdive\n3.000000\n\n\nif i am\nmy bloody valentine\n-1.400000\n\n\nonly shallow\nmy bloody valentine\n2.000000\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the table above, we find that Ride’s saddest songs are ‘I Came to See the Wreck’ and ‘Only Now’, and happiest songs is ‘The Dawn Patrol’; Slowdive’s saddest song is ‘The Sadman’, and happiest songs is ‘Everyone Knows’; mbv’s saddest song is ‘if i am’, and happiest song is ‘only shallow’. The Sadman is really sad.\n\n\n\nAre bands trending towards happiness or sadness over time?\n\nafinn_score &lt;- token_afinn %&gt;%\n  group_by(Artist, Album, Release.Year) %&gt;%\n  summarize(avg = mean(value))\n\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nggplot(afinn_score,\n       aes(x = Release.Year, y = avg, color = Artist, label = Album)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_text_repel(size = 3) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = 'dashed', color = 'black') +\n  scale_color_manual(values = palette) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-1,1)) +\n  labs(\n    title = 'Sentiment Trend of Lyrics Over Time',\n    caption = 'Average sentiment score calculated based on afinn scores.\\n&lt;0: sad/negative, &gt;0: happy/positive.',\n    color = 'Artist',\n    y = 'Sentiment Score', \n    x = 'Time'\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen examining the trend over time, it is noteworthy that at the beginning of their careers, the bands all had very sad lyrics; in the middle of their careers, their lyrics became more positive. It is also interesting to observe that the latest albums of mbv, Ride, and Slowdive are all among the saddest of their entire careers.",
