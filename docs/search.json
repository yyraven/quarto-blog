Both viruses pose significant public health challenges due to their widespread transmission and potential for severe disease.\nClimate and weather conditions can influence the activity and spread of both viruses. Studies have suggested that factors like cold temperatures, low indoor humidity, limited sunlight, and rapid weather changes may increase the risk of disease outbreaks.",

    "section": "1 Introduction",
    "text": "1 Introduction\n\n1.1 Why This Project\nI’m interested in the ‘shoegaze’ subgenre of indie rock. This less-known genre, also called ‘the scene that celebrates itself’, rose from the noise pop scene in the late 80s and early 90s, and has regained popularity recently. An article titled ‘The Shoegaze Revival Hit Its Stride in 2023’1 by pitchfork also captures the revival of shoegaze among GenZ populations.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy bloody valentine’s 1988 EP ‘You made me realise’ is a classic shoegaze record.\n\n\nShoegaze is characterized by heavy use of overdriven guitar and various effect pedals with the combination of the ethereal vocals; the lyrics are often regarded as blank, poetic, and sometimes difficult to distinguish from the instruments. So here comes this project for the indieheads - I want to analyze those usually overlooked lyrics, especially from the perspective of sentiment.\nThe bands I want to study are the so-called classic ‘big-three’ of shoegaze: my bloody valentine, Ride, and slowdive. They were all on the independent record label Creation from London, UK, reached their peak in early 90s, disbanded in late 90s due to the fading of the subgenre, and reunited in the 21st century, which make them a perfect fit to study the changes in the lyrics over the years.\n\n\n1.2 My Questions\n\nWhat words frequently appear in their lyrics?\nWhich bands have the longest and shortest lyrics?\nWho is the saddest shoegaze band?\nAre bands trending towards happiness or sadness over time?",

Only the top 30 results are shown here.'\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result is kind of amusing. Ride and mbv rely their vocals heavily on harmonies and hummings - and it’s reflected honestly here, while slowdive has the most ‘meaningful’ lyrics among the three. ‘Love’ is the ultimate meaning of rock and roll, and it indeed appears in high frequency in all of their lyrics.\n\n\n2.2.2 Which bands have the longest and shortest lyrics?\n\n# plotting\nggplot(lyrics_clean, aes(x = Album, y = lyric.length, fill = Artist)) + \n  geom_boxplot(color = 'black') +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = palette) +\n  labs(\n    title = 'Which bands have the Longest/Shortest Lyrics?',\n    caption = 'Boxplot showing the range and median of lyric lengths for each Album.', \n    color = 'Before Reunion?', \n    y = 'Lyric Length (character)'\n  ) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the three bands, Mbv always has the shortest lyrics overall while Ride has the longest. An interesting trend is that while Ride and slowdive have similar lyric length back in the 90s, after reunion, Ride tends to have longer lyrics - and the length increases for each album.\n\n\n2.2.3 Who is the saddest shoegaze band?\nI used afinn from package tidytext for sentiment analysis based on this paper3.\n\n# data processing: sentiment 'afinn'\ntoken_count &lt;- token_clean %&gt;%\n  group_by(Artist, Album, Release.Year) %&gt;%\n  count(Word, name = 'Word_count', sort = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\ntoken_afinn &lt;- token_count %&gt;%\n  inner_join(get_sentiments('afinn'), by = c(\"Word\" = \"word\"))\n\nafinn_score_by_artist &lt;- token_afinn %&gt;%\n  group_by(Artist) %&gt;%\n  summarize(avg = round(mean(value), 2)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\nkable(afinn_score_by_artist)\n\n\n\n\nArtist\navg\n\n\n\n\nRide\n-0.06\n\n\nSlowdive\n0.00\n\n\nmy bloody valentine\n-0.11\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the three bands, mbv has the lowest sentiment score, which means it is the saddest shoegaze band (if we only look at the lyrics). All three bands got sentiment scores less than or equal to zero, with slowdive holding the highest score (0.00).\n\n2.2.3.1 What about their greatest hits?\nUsing data from last.fm, we find out that the greatest hits of the three bands are:\n\nwhen you sleep - my bloody valentine (32171 weekly listeners),\nVapour Trail - Ride (1943 weekly listeners), and\nWhen the Sun Hits - Slowdive (53055 weekly listeners).\n\nI’m interested that whether those songs have a happier or sadder vibe compared to their other songs -\n\n# by song\ntoken_count_bysong &lt;- token_clean %&gt;%\n  group_by(Artist, Song.Title) %&gt;%\n  count(Word, name = 'Word_count', sort = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n# give afinn score\ntoken_afinn_bysong &lt;- token_count_bysong %&gt;%\n  inner_join(get_sentiments('afinn'), by = c(\"Word\" = \"word\"))\n\n# clean data set, drop songs with only 1/2 rows\ntoken_afinn_bysong &lt;- token_afinn_bysong %&gt;%\n  group_by(Song.Title) %&gt;%\n  filter(n() &gt; 2) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n# calculate average scores\nafinn_score_all &lt;- token_afinn_bysong %&gt;%\n  group_by(Song.Title, Artist) %&gt;%\n  summarize(avg_song = mean(value))\n\n# look at the greatest hits\nafinn_score_gh &lt;- afinn_score_all %&gt;%\n  filter(Song.Title == 'Vapour Trail' | Song.Title == 'When the Sun Hits' | Song.Title == 'when you sleep')\n\n# combine datasets for plotting\nafinn_score_gh &lt;- inner_join(afinn_score_gh, afinn_score_by_artist, by = c(\"Artist\" = \"Artist\"))\n\n# plot\nggplot(afinn_score_gh, aes(x = Artist)) +\n  geom_point(shape = 16, size = 3, aes(y = afinn_score_gh$avg, color = Artist)) +\n  geom_point(shape = 17, size = 3, aes(y = afinn_score_gh$avg_song, color = \nSong.Title)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = palette) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = 'dashed', color = 'black') +\n  labs(\n    title = 'Who is the Saddest Shoegaze Band?',\n    caption = 'Average sentiment score calculated based on afinn scores.\\n&lt;0: sad/negative, &gt;0: happy/positive.', \n    y = 'Sentiment Score', \n    x = 'Time', \n    color = 'Artist average/\\ngreatest hits'\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMbv has the lowest overall sentiment score. All those songs have a slightly higher sentiment score than their artist’s average scores. People seem to prefer happy songs!\n\n\n2.2.3.2 So what are their happiest/saddest songs?\n\nextreme_song &lt;- afinn_score_all %&gt;%\n  group_by(Artist) %&gt;%\n  filter(avg_song == max(avg_song) | avg_song == min(avg_song)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\nsorted_tibble &lt;- extreme_song %&gt;%\n  group_by(Artist) %&gt;%\n  arrange(Artist, avg_song) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\nkable(sorted_tibble)\n\n\n\n\nSong.Title\nArtist\navg_song\n\n\n\n\nI Came to See the Wreck\nRide\n-1.500000\n\n\nOnly Now\nRide\n-1.500000\n\n\nThe Dawn Patrol\nRide\n2.000000\n\n\nThe Sadman\nSlowdive\n-2.333333\n\n\nEveryone Knows\nSlowdive\n3.000000\n\n\nif i am\nmy bloody valentine\n-1.400000\n\n\nonly shallow\nmy bloody valentine\n2.000000\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the table above, we find that Ride’s saddest songs are ‘I Came to See the Wreck’ and ‘Only Now’, and happiest songs is ‘The Dawn Patrol’; Slowdive’s saddest song is ‘The Sadman’, and happiest songs is ‘Everyone Knows’; mbv’s saddest song is ‘if i am’, and happiest song is ‘only shallow’. The Sadman is really sad.\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Are bands trending towards happiness or sadness over time?\n\nafinn_score &lt;- token_afinn %&gt;%\n  group_by(Artist, Album, Release.Year) %&gt;%\n  summarize(avg = mean(value))\n\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nggplot(afinn_score,\n       aes(x = Release.Year, y = avg, color = Artist, label = Album)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_text_repel(size = 3) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = 'dashed', color = 'black') +\n  scale_color_manual(values = palette) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-1,1)) +\n  labs(\n    title = 'Sentiment Trend of Lyrics Over Time',\n    caption = 'Average sentiment score calculated based on afinn scores.\\n&lt;0: sad/negative, &gt;0: happy/positive.',\n    color = 'Artist',\n    y = 'Sentiment Score', \n    x = 'Time'\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen examining the trend over time, it is noteworthy that at the beginning of their careers, the bands all had very sad lyrics; in the middle of their careers, their lyrics became more positive. It is also interesting to observe that the latest albums of mbv, Ride, and Slowdive are all among the saddest of their entire careers.",

    "text": "3 Bonus: Here Comes the RIDE Fan!\nRIDE blew my mind when I attended their Nowhere concert with the Charlatans back in Jan 2024 in the amazing venue Union Transfer, Philadelphia. Since then I’ve become a huge fan… So I couldn’t help but did more data analysis on them (!).\nDisclaimer: I’m by no means overlooking the members who do not write the lyrics. I love you Steve. It’s just because I can only do text analysis at this time.\n\n3.1 My Questions\n\nWho writes the lyrics in each album?\nWhat’s the most frequently used words for each lyricist before/after reunion?\nTop 5 Words for Each Album\nWho is the Saddest Lyricist?\nAre they trending towards happiness or sadness over time?\n\n\n\n3.2 Data Wrangling\nInformation about lyric writers were from interviews and record sleeves.\n\n# assign lyricist\nandy_bell_songs &lt;- c(\"Drive Blind\", \"Close My Eyes\", \"Like A Daydream\", \"Silver\", \"Dreams Burn Down\", \"Here And Now\", \"Seagull\", \"Kaleidoscope\", \"In a Different Place\", \"Polar Bear\", \"Paralysed\", \"Vapour Trail\", \"Sennen\", \"Beneath\", \"Today\", \"Not Fazed\", \"Chrome Waves\", \"Time of Her Time\", \"Cool Your Boots\", \"Making Judy Smile\", \"Going Blank Again\", \"Howard Hughes\", \"Birdman\", \"Crown of Creation\", \"Endless Road\", \"Magical Spring\", \"I Don’t Know Where It Comes From\", \"Sunshine/Nowhere To Run\", \"Dead Man\", \"Walk on Water\", \"Mary Anne\", \"Castle On The Hill\", \"Gonna Be Alright\", \"The Dawn Patrol\", \"Ride The Wind\", \"Burnin’\", \"Starlight Motel\", \"Charm Assault\", \"Home Is A Feeling\", \"Weather Diaries\", \"Lateral Alice\", \"Cali\", \"Impermanence\",\"Cold Water People\", \"Catch You Dreaming\", \"Future Love\", \"Repetition\", \"Kill Switch\", \"Clouds of Saint Marie\", \"Fifteen Minutes\", \"Jump Jet\", \"Dial Up\", \"End Game\", \"In This Room\", \"Peace Sign\", \"Last Frontier\", \"Light in a Quiet Room\", \"Stay Free\", \"Last Night I Went Somewhere to Dream\", \"Midnight Rider\", \"Portland Rocks\", \"Yesterday Is Just a Song\")\n\nmark_gardener_songs &lt;- c(\"Chelsea Girl\", \"All I Can See\", \"Furthest Sense\", \"Perfect Time\", \"Taste\", \"Decay\", \"Unfamiliar\", \"Leave Them All Behind\", \"Twisterella\", \"Mouse Trap\", \"Time Machine\", \"OX4\", \"Stampede\", \"Moonlight Medicine\", \"1000 Miles\", \"From Time To Time\", \"Only Now\", \"Deep Inside My Pocket\", \"Lannoy Point\", \"White Sands\", \"Pulsar\", \"Keep It Surreal\", \"Shadows Behind the Sun\", \"Monaco\", \"I Came to See the Wreck\", \"Sunrise Chaser\", \"Essaouira\")\n\nloz_colbert_songs &lt;- c(\"Nowhere\", \"Natural Grace\", \"Rocket Silver Symphony\", \"R.I.D.E.\")\n\ncollab_songs &lt;- c(\"All I Want\", \"Eternal Recurrence\")\n\ncover_songs &lt;- c(\"How Does It Feel to Feel?\")\n\nlyrics_ride &lt;- lyrics_ride %&gt;%\n  mutate(lyricist = case_when(\n         Song.Title %in% andy_bell_songs ~ \"Andy.Bell\",\n         Song.Title %in% mark_gardener_songs ~ \"Mark.Gardener\",\n         Song.Title %in% loz_colbert_songs ~ \"Loz.Colbert\",\n         Song.Title %in% collab_songs ~ \"collaboration\",\n         Song.Title %in% cover_songs ~ \"cover\",\n         TRUE ~ NA_character_\n         ),\n         Album = fct_reorder(Album, Release.Date),\n         is90 = Release.Year &lt;

    "text": "✎2874 \n   ♥\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n这篇是直接从备忘录里搬过来的，一字未改。虽然很矫情，但是是我的社会化之始，很有纪念意义（？\n\n\n\n\n荚蒾\n\n就很怨恨也很怀念这件事。让我彻底想明白了感情存在的意义和表达的方法，虽然现在实践经验还不多，但总归在思想上打通了它发展的道路。最好笑的是这完全是自己在钻牛角尖把自己给整抑郁了，红莓花你知不知道这件事我都难讲。感情爆炸的结果就是你现在根本不敢讲当时多少东西是真的存在过，多少东西只是我的脑子在现实空间的投射。毕竟人的脑子有多不可靠大家都知道。\n查到俄语原文的红莓花儿是荚蒾。那也是白色的了，当时为什么会用红莓花儿来比喻你呢。\n\n“Милый мой, хороший, догадайся сам”\n\n殚精竭虑地找了个典雅的比喻用来告慰我的初恋，而你的名字就和夏天的风一样，在看到六月白白的栀子花的一瞬间就想到了。还真是好玩的隐喻啊……\n并且我真的是够贱，青春期读的所有悲情爱情小说，弗洛伦蒂诺和费尔明娜（你算什么弗洛伦蒂诺），赫里内勒多和阿玛兰妲（你算什么赫里内勒多），贾宝玉和林黛玉（你算什么贾宝玉，而我又算什么林黛玉）甚至EVA（你也算不上明日香），都用来代红莓花，你给我任何好处了吗？真的是。16岁的我，画一颗甜枣就争着想用你的手扇自己巴掌……无法享受当下相处的任何时光，每一分每一秒都是焦灼，不知道自己想要什么，只知道我对你有强烈的感情，而这种感情即将把我烧死了。唉。而栀子花，你给我的都是鼓励和善良，让我开始反思自己的乖戾和愤世嫉俗是不是理所应当的……你多好。只是站在那里就够了，就能把我从自毁里救出来。所以我一直觉得单恋比起献殷勤，更加是一个对自我的挖掘过程，将对方的优缺点投射在自己身上，在一遍一遍的比较中找出自己需要进步的地方和对方“也不是那么厉害嘛”的地方。所以我本质上不是认为两个人寂寞了就会互相吸引的\n但现在在解构了爱情以后发现实际上也就是两个寂寞的平凡人互相吸引互相告慰罢了。毕竟我也不是阿玛兰妲，也不是费尔明娜。甚至费尔明娜也柴米油盐过了大半辈子呢，最后与弗洛伦蒂诺的结合带来的也不过是垂垂暮年的又几日柴米油盐。但他们能从中感到幸福，或许吧。有的时候裸睡醒来觉得如果我能把整个上半身趴在别人身上就好了，这是一种动物本能的幸福感，猫猫被挠下巴的幸福感。\n人果然还是群居动物。发现那么多人和我一样困在Nihilism里感觉果然好多了（叹\n\n\n发现有人居然不是每天都很忧郁这一点才是令人最惊讶的\n\n或者说我的生命底调就是非常忧郁的。没有接受刺激的时候就很忧郁，也不知道为什么。\n说是敏感的人一般原生家庭不和睦（但实际上黏糊糊），小时候遭到不公平对待（小学时期的确，班里的氛围挺相互猜忌的，在家里也被爷爷骂，不过也不至于），父母离异（并没有），但在这一切的一切发生以前，我妈就说我小时候一被陌生人碰到就哭，宁愿自己呆着也没有和同学厮混翻一起……\n所以这是为什么呢。\n长大以后这种独自相处的时间就变成我逐渐构建起自己忧郁的世界观的时间\n“人生本来就是没有意义的”\n……\n这种忧郁感来自何方……\n其实我觉得百年孤独实在是对我影响非常大的一本书。15岁读的……从此构成了我对爱情、或者说感性世界一切认识的基础\n情欲、爱、孤独\n孤独……\n\n\n为什么说离开荚蒾时的我处在人生中最抑郁的时间\n\n一个是刚上高中，成绩落差很大自尊心破碎而产生的自卑心理（当时被爱情的热血掩盖了，没能及时觉察真正的本质原因），能从日记里一直过于神化你的成就看出来。\n一个是无意义感……因为开始思考人生的意义，下意识觉得追赶别人这一件事已经不能激起我的动力了吧（现在的确，单纯的比较再也支持不了我了，这是翻初中的日记翻到有那么多对竞争对手的痛骂时忽然发现的）。记得当时写，听了职业生涯规划大会，看到玥和她女朋友亲亲热热地一起去打球，感觉做什么都没有意思，做一桶泡面或者做浮萍就此在阳关下烂掉和做高中生的意义并无不同。但是“只要你冲我笑一下，也就有了做数学题的动力。或者只要风油精抹太阳穴就可以了。”当时一直觉得我活下去的原因一个是怕家人伤心，一个是怕痛。实在是不知道奋斗的快感和意义到底是什么、即使是某一个年级位比以及基于此的分解目标，也不明白到底是为了什么……可能就是最后一点自尊心在支着跑下去……所以最后真的在考场上整个人是抽离的\n现阶段坚信的人生意义说是在大学找到的也不为过。所以我是很相信学校提供的“非物质/实用/成绩价值”的……因为如果不彻底想通，人就不会有前进的动力。大学真的能塑造一个人。\n要说高中带给了我什么，主要是温柔和善良。谢谢五班，谢谢世界上最温柔的班主任，还有我的好朋友小王和佳，还有我的栀子花。另外就是加强了一点我本来就有的傲气和忧郁，这个得感谢杭老师，啊对，杭老师还叫我们不要不努力光做梦。\n红莓花，你到底为我的青春做了什么贡献，我也不明白。似乎全部都是负面影响：十六岁开始抑郁差不多一整年、一遇到男的就一惊一乍怕重蹈覆辙不说，现在爱情也变成我能彻底抽离解构的存在了（不过我这个见一个爱一个的性格怪不了你，我从小就这样）。对爱情去神圣化、开始逐渐接受异性的正常存在也是到了大学以后的事……谢谢小W……不过你到底带给了我什么呢。最好的说法是你是我的青春在马尔克斯世界里的投射。或者说你在马尔克斯世界里的投射是我的青春。想不明白。以后每次告诫自己都是“不要暗恋”、“不要stk”、“不要贬低自我价值”、“不要爱上滤镜里的那个人”、“不要被吊桥效应冲昏头脑”……似乎你是彻底的反面范本……现在想起来也没啥好心动的。日本文学男，无聊透了。倒也不是因为你所以不喜欢日本文学的……最早觉得你也不过如此就是因为你喜欢日本文学。\n总之现在我也不恨你了，也没什么好恨的，我不也狠狠在情绪上刺伤过你吗。你也有理由恨我呢。当时多傻，以为只要在对方心里尽可能留下深刻的痕迹就公平了。现在才知道原来对喜欢的人可以很温柔。\n\n\n看了一会儿知乎的心理学矫情小论文\n\n看起来我的确是曾经有过回避型依恋的显著特征，但也明显被治愈了很多，感谢妈咪，感谢朋友们。\n不过那上面也说回避型如果没有经受过重大打击是意识不到自己的思维方式有问题的。唉，红莓花，你可能是我的牺牲品吧，我的高考数学成绩也是我的牺牲品。不过人生有那么长，有那么多条路呢。这么想，用破碎的一年换以后的大半辈子精神世界不再（那么）痛苦，似乎也是一件好事。并且我也没太伤害到你……希望吧。\n也可以说EVA最后大家围成一圈拍手的场景狠狠地治愈了我。就，逃避又有什么错，接纳又有什么错。不开EVA妈妈也会爱你，开EVA不是因为爸爸的要求，而是因为“我想要”保护我爱的人。“我可以呆在这个世界！”\n真不知道自己的心理问题哪儿来的。和小W说我一旦上头就会忍不住把情绪内化为刀狠狠戳自己，搅得自己不得安宁，没法干任何事。小W说她才不会呢。我说可能是因为单恋吧。唉。小W真好。她和栀子花就是两个能指出我“不正常”之处，但在引导上又很细心，共情得也很温柔的人。真好。妈妈有的时候，或者说大多数时候也是很好的。我永远记得因为在初三不能有效安慰小PP而落泪时，妈妈说你其实已经做得很好了。小王自己是母单，没有太大说服力，不过她也能听我说话，不以为我是异类，并且最近明显心理也成长得越来越好了。真好。大家都在长大，长大也不只是坏事。其实SY和XF姐也很好。只是我初中的时候还是太傲……红莓花你真是有好大作用啊！\n不过开口还是很难为情。\n加持良治是所有自以为心理出了问题的矫情女孩的理想完美恋人吧……“人是无法完全理解别人的，甚至能否理解自己都值得怀疑，百分百互相理解是不可能的。不过呢，正因为如此，人们才会努力去了解自己和他人，所以人生才会有乐趣啊”\n同样是无条件的爱，我还是喜欢加持多过渚薰，因为薰像一个天使，像一个神。和加持与美里一样在夏天的出租房里胡天胡地真是我对浪漫的终极想象。\n\n\n\n  Kudos ♥\n\n\n\n© 2024-2026 RavensNest.",

    "text": "✎888 \n   ♥\n\n\n又是一年青年节。\n我想来点理想主义，想为我的人生和时代找点意义。高中的时候至少有语文课和历史课。学国际史的时候，只要老师还不是行尸走肉，总会好好讲法国大革命，以及前后发生的一切。语文课会讲《人类的群星闪耀时》。上大学前，我曾这么想过：以后每天都要有学习的时间，玩儿的时间，读书的时间，和发呆的时间——现在回想一下，这个想法很美好，但多少有点不贴近实际：一方面，书相比高中时候读得太少了；另一方面是这四件事都非常私人化，接触的人也太少，一直这样下去容易钻牛角尖。\n高中起，我就一直把鲁迅《热风》里那段“如果竟没有炬火，我便是唯一的光”贴在书撑上来激励自己关注现实，但实际执行上却遇到了很多困难。作为一个大学生，我到底能做什么呢？看着社会新闻辗转难眠的夜晚，除了点点屏幕，转发评论以外，似乎什么都做不了；第二天醒来一切都404，什么记录都不会留下。而“在自己的本职上发光发热就好”这种理论，放到现实生活里也就是好好学习好好考试，和高中两耳不闻窗外事的状态也没有什么区别。充斥着现代娱乐的大学生活真的让人好空虚，信息来源增多了理论基础却没跟上，多得是无根浮萍一般的抱怨和口嗨，发泄了一时的情绪却没有任何实际的效用，难道我甘愿就这么烂在现代社会的疮疤里吗。\n上通识课的时候，M在文摘里批判无政府主义，意大利老安那其教授呵呵一笑说你根本不了解无政府主义。其实我自己也经常这样，每天钻牛角尖，但稍微多了解一下就能发现自己以为的死路其实不过是整个路线网中的一条罢了。教授上课明着鄙视DS人，对生物人（我和M和两位友友）没说啥，可能真的还挺喜欢舌灿莲花的M和我。但我想说学基础科学何尝不是一种逃避…至少对我来说是一种逃避。逃避自己身为政治动物的现实。\n思而不学则殆，很简单的道理。我要多读书，不要逃避文科（因为即使学了理还是常常为了社会新闻和哲学问题彻夜难眠），不要逃避思考（即不能放任自己从情绪/立场出发看问题），努力朝着合格的现代公民和靠谱的成年人这个方向迈进。值得欣慰的是，无论如何，这三年来的确成长了很多。虽然也多了许多的困惑，但也是逐渐找到所谓的unknown unknown的过程吧？\n\n\n\n  Kudos ♥\n\n\n\n© 2024-2026 RavensNest.",

    "text": "✎2431 \n   ♥\n\n\n这是我在看完RIDE/The Charlatans的Between Nowhere Tour以后在狂热状态下写的日记。\n现在回想起来，那种快乐到眩晕的状态可能一辈子都不会再体验到了。因为疫情原因，在这场演出以前，我只看过校园乐队的小演出和没什么感觉的大团的arena演出。这是我第一次在这么近、这么小的场馆里看到水平很棒的、我很喜欢的乐队演出，身边还有亲密的朋友；RIDE的四个人带着他们的爆裂音响就这样杵在我面前，简直是根本不够看。第一次看到吉他手离我这么近地表演solo，那冲击力真是不一般。喝酒也没有经验，狂灌了一整瓶。费城Union Transfer的音量是我去过的场馆里最响的，当时我又不知道要戴耳塞，最后耳鸣了一晚上，然后拖着这个破听力和朋友躺在床上不停地反刍。那天还在下雪，当时我还是那种刚搬到北方的南方人，看到雪地还会兴奋，还没有开始讨厌冬天。\n以后去看多著名的乐队或许都不会有这种感觉了，因为只属于我的蒙娜丽莎我早已遇见……\n\n回巴尔的摩的火车真是太晃了。\n度过了一个非常不错的周末！周五中午开完组会后和Ⰶ去学校里玩雪，玩了一个小时，然后乘Amtrak去了费城，在♫家和𓃝以及♫的室友一起吃了晚饭，她们做了腊肠饭，牛仔骨和虾饺，每个都好吃得离谱，非常满足。\n18:45我们打车去了Union Transfer。整个下午我一直非常担心演出被取消，因为美国东北部在下暴风雪，我们大学的官方活动都被取消了。到达目的地以后，等的人已经在门口排成了一条长队，我就安心太多了，并且也很开心这么多人愿意提早一个小时过来。我们过了安检，买了酒，然后就跑到前排去等着了，心情简直就是飘飘欲仙的激动。\n\n\n\n\n\nUnion Transfer平面图\n\n\nThe Charlatans的部分我迅速带过。他们的主唱Tim Burgess巨会营业：当你还在为“我不是单纯来朝圣的，有5%的我是想在演出结束后发Instagram”而感到愧疚时，Tim已经在演出中间掏出手机号召大家挥手蹦迪，然后把手机倒过来拍自己了，网感未免有点太好。\n中场休息时酒瓶已空。舞台的灯光是绿色的，我们站在第三排左侧的位置等着巡演工作人员把设备调好。我和朋友开玩笑说，待会儿可能就没有这么多营业了，因为Mark和Andy都有吉他在手上，腾不出手来指挥蹦迪。最先搬上来的是写着RIDE的底鼓，然后是三个效果器板，Steve的在左边，中间是Mark的，右边是Andy的。虽然完全不懂单块，一种强烈的瘙痒的冲动还是让我踮着脚努力去看板上到底有什么。伟大的建筑一般的电路系统啊。Mark有一个红色的块，上面的两行光点不停的来回闪动。吉他也搬出来了，两把Rickenbacker，一把樱桃红的，一把红色的；两把Gretsch，一把红的(其实是Trini Lopez)，一把原木色的。这时，音响里切到了Blur的The Narcissist。我忽然感觉这是我在The Ballad of Darren发行半年后第一次真正与这首歌共情。与朋友们微醺地站在台下等着喜爱的乐队上台的感觉如此之好，人生能有几次这样的经历呀？之前一直吐槽这首歌是Damon Albarn年近60终于把抑郁症治好了，现在只觉得幸福。可能是疫情的原因吧，身边的联系都显得愈发珍贵起来。\n\n\n\n\n\n对耳膜宝具！\n\n\n接着，灯光渐暗，音乐变成低沉而逐渐加快的鼓点。后台的灯光亮了起来，观众席里的嘈杂声落了下来，最后变成一阵阵的欢呼和尖叫。乐队成员上台了，我一边狂跳一边举着一个Love from China的牌牌，Mark问：大家好吗？准备好了吗？那就开始吧。\nSeagull，狂风暴雨一般的嘶鸣声；Kaleidoscope，脑浆跟着吉他一起旋转；In a different place, 灯光似乎和音乐一起升腾；Polar bear, “如果云会唱歌，那就这就是它的声音”……\nDreams burn down开始之前，Mark逗观众一定要报出歌名才演，还一再嫌大家喊得不够响，一直努力保持矜持的我便再也无法忍受，发出了尖锐的爆鸣声。Loz的鼓太帅了。每一首歌都很完美。做实验的时候听的音乐，冬季闲逛看海时听的音乐，现在就在离我如此之近的舞台上，以这样暴力、直白、美丽的方式爆炸，震碎我的鼓膜直达灵魂。Vapour trail的前奏响起的时候我没有录像，而是百分百地投入合唱。音量如此之响，我基本聋了，听到Andy的声音是完全变形了的，但还是很开心。清新的旋律和单纯美丽的歌词，就像第一次点开Nowhere的那一刻一般，就像初恋一般。Tim给Here and Now合了口琴，我从未意识到口琴可以拥有这样近乎暴力的美感。然后是Nowhere, Lannoy Point, Monaco和新歌Peace Sign。前排的姐姐们应该是铁粉，在Peace Sign的副歌特别给面子地举起双手，比出“耶”的手势应援。收尾曲是Leave Them All Behind。前奏那段采样出来的时候我真的要哭了。Mark喝了一口他那蜂蜜威士忌，Andy看着笑一笑，Steve铺垫着前奏，然后两把Gretsch一起加进来。天呐，我离得那么近，近得可以看到每一个和弦变换和每一个推弦；所有的声音以一种迷幻又充满力量的方式在我脑后一块酸涩的区域混合起来。I don’t care about the colors, I don’t care about the light, I don’t care about the truth… 然后是吉他独奏——主旋律的变奏加上哇音踏板，音符跟着鼓点迸发出来，如此明亮，仿佛鸟儿沐浴着晨光从混沌的黑暗中挣扎而出。最后的outro是一浪高过一浪的音墙，就像刹车失效的公路旅行和不会有终点的逃亡……\n接着魔法师停下了魔咒。Andy说，谢谢，希望我们能很快再见。 Loz给大家拍了照，我们在上面。\n再接着就是长长的、似乎永远都不会结束的后劲。乘着这份飘飘欲仙的心情，我花了35刀买了丑丑的巡演T恤，在Union Transfer “sold out”的告示牌前面拍了照，在回♫家的出租车上跟着广播哼starman，最后变成大合唱；第二天幸福而无所顾忌地倒在费城美术馆前洁白松软的积雪上。\n回到巴尔的摩后，真的感觉有变得更加热爱生活。我对♫说想把这一刻的幸福全部榨出来，风干储存，这样每次想回忆的时候就能掏出来看看，就又有力量可以继续生活了。我真的可以如此贪心吗？但至少到星期三的现在，坐在实验室的椅子上写这篇日记时，那种不可思议的快乐的心情依然存在。Maybe it’s really, really, really can happen!\n再也吹不出那样的彩虹屁，看了也会红着脸躲避\n\n\n\n  Kudos ♥\n\n\n\n© 2024-2026 RavensNest.",

    "text": "✎4806 \n   ♥\n这里是美国国歌的诞生地，南北方的分野，内战的前线，弗雷德里克·道格拉斯的奔向自由的地方，爱伦坡长眠的地方。这个城市有无数绰号：最伟大的城市（The Greatest City in America），魅力之城（Charm City），读书之城（the City that Reads），当然还有臭名昭著的谋杀州爆头城（Bodymore, Murderland）。这里是巴尔的摩，我过去两年生活的城市。\n我是一个很念旧的人，但同时又懒又健忘，离别之时内心充盈的无数情感落到纸上的不足百分之一，过了几年脑子里剩的那些也会忘个精光。为了让未来的自己不至于说“在美国的最初两年生活乏善可陈”，这次我想至少把一些印象深刻的故事记录下来；有了博客这个方便的工具，也不用找笔没墨、写字慢这些借口了。我的舒适区是音乐，就先从音乐开始写；以后还想写这座城市的历史与文化，写我的大学，还有遇见的人。在巴尔的摩生活的时候恨得很，走路不敢看手机，生怕被街上的人突袭，每天被邮箱里弹出的校警安全提示折磨得夜不能寐，觉得去哪儿都比留下来好；离开后又开始舍不得了——开始怀念静谧的港口之夜，满树的樱花和碧蓝的海水，一排排站在码头上休息的环嘴鸥，还有水里漂浮着的美丽的海刺水母。\n城市是过去、现在与未来所有居民共同想象的结果，居住在这里的我不可避免地会对它产生更多的感情。对“城市”的迷恋始于中学读《看不见的城市》后的感受。卡尔维诺在书中写马可·波罗向忽必烈可汗描述他游历过的每个城市，中学的我着迷于作者精巧的文风和笔下优美的意象。马可说，“记忆的形象一旦被词语固定下来就会消失了；也许我不愿意讲述威尼斯是害怕失去它”——或许家乡之于我而言是这样一座不可触碰的城，但对巴尔的摩，我要做的就是把它用自己的词语固定下来。回忆总是会扭曲现实，这是大脑自带的功能，但我觉得与其让这份回忆堕落成简单的谈资（“我在美国最危险的城市里活下来了诶！”），不如让它以浪漫化的形式留下来。\n作为留学生在巴尔的摩求学，我总会觉得自己离真实的市民生活有一些距离。23年8月刚入学时我曾写下“早起，乘校车飞驰过这座城市，带着花纹的窗户贴面外是涂鸦和灰蒙蒙的街区，校车内冷气很足，男男女女穿着得体的衣服，戴着眼镜，和电视剧里的莱农很像。有的时候会怀疑自己是否真的能去感受到这座城市的脉搏，尤其是在巴市这种地方……”霍普金斯大学对学生的保护让我觉得自己可以在不接触巴尔的摩的情况下在大学的泡泡里生活——因为害怕危险所以不乘坐公共交通工具，完全只在校车能覆盖的范围内行动；因为不清楚他人是善是恶，精神是否清醒，所以只和学校内的老师和同学交往。这都是可以做到的，甚至是被鼓励的。一次一位来自阿富汗的优步司机甚至提醒我“你就别在那下车了，早点离开这里比较好，这里的人都是‘僵尸’。”但一个人怎么可以放任自己活在封闭到这种程度的象牙塔里呢？\n由于社交能力实在欠缺，我最后选择的融入城市的方法就是多散步。散步的时候自然是要戴着耳机的，这就导致这座城的每一条路在我回忆里都有自带的背景音乐。而音乐是最方便的创造浪漫回忆的工具。关于此事，爱伦坡也有高见：\n就这样，耳机里的音乐和眼前的景色——或是萧瑟的19世纪式排屋，或是静谧的内港——结合成了无言的诗。过去两年我最爱的放松活动就是乘校车在内港边的商学院下车，沿着海岸一路逛到Thames Street的唱片店The Sound Garden，翻一个小时唱片，买一张或者空手而归，去旁边的意式冰激凌店Pitango买一份开心果/树莓味的双球冰激凌，再在小雨里逛回商学院。有一次在海边吹风时还看到有人提着一个巨大的音箱在放Cocteau Twins的Heaven or Las Vegas，夕阳将雨后初晴的海面映照成浅浅的蓝紫色，停在海边的战舰的灰色舷窗上泛出粉色的光芒，配上Elizabeth Fraser的吟唱，那个场景真是如梦似幻啊。\n在过去的两年里，我主要沉迷于以RIDE为首的盯鞋/梦幻流行音乐。23年感恩节假期我在内港边吃西北风时点开了Nowhere，两把吉他组成的音乐风暴与眼前青灰色的深秋海面在我脑内产生了奇妙的化学作用，从此这种音乐就和“海”的意象分不开了。此外，本着入乡随俗的原则，我还努力探索了巴尔的摩的本地音乐。巴尔的摩有很繁荣的音乐场景：实验摇滚先驱Frank Zappa在这里出生，仙乐组合Beach House在这里成立，硬核朋克乐队Turnstile带着他们急促愤怒的鼓点和嘶吼席卷了全球；这里也是舞曲流派Baltimore Club的发源地，它的影响力在30年后依然存在，还间接地协助缔造了几首K-pop热单。\n盯鞋/梦幻流行音乐我已在2024年的音乐电台里推荐过很多，不必再说；就用这篇文章剩余的部分推荐一点喜欢的巴尔的摩本地音乐人，和常去的唱片店与演出场馆吧。",

    "text": "巴尔的摩的音乐家与音乐地标\n\n\n\n\n\n\n学艺不精，有不准确或者不完善的地方请多多包涵。\n\n\n\n\n摇滚/流行/另类\n\n\n\n\n\n2019年发行的Peaches en Regalia画胶\n\n\n冷知识： 2007年8月9日被巴尔的摩市长定为Frank Zappa Day。\n\nFrank Zappa\n著名的实验摇滚先驱。放在这里其实有点牵强，因为他很快就搬到加州去了。早年在巴尔的摩的经历包括吸军营里的芥子气，鼻子里塞镭治病，和在卧室里玩老爹化工厂的水银，堪称一个五毒俱全。他的音乐涵盖摇滚、流行、爵士，听听蛮有意思的；我第一次听到是在《春光乍泄》里。\n\nFrank Zappa - Chunga’s Revenge (1970) 被选入了《春光乍泄》的电影原声带。顺带一提，《春光乍泄》的英文片名Happy Together就是一首歌，原唱是The Turtles，电影里也出现了Zappa的翻唱版。\nFrank Zappa - Peaches en Regalia (1969) 很有意思的爵士小曲。\n\n\n\nBeach House\n\n\n\n\n\nBeach House - Teen Dream\n\n\n来自法国的Victoria和来自巴尔的摩的Alex组成的二人梦幻流行组合。\n\nBeach House - Silver Soul (2010) 悠远的滑棒吉他就像港口的夜色一般令人平静。\n\n\n\nAnimal Collective\n迷幻流行乐队，融入了不少电子成分，很擅长营造沉浸式的氛围。\n\nAnimal Collective - Merriweather Post Pavilion (2009) 最经典的一张，蛮喜欢的。\n\n\n\nSnail Mail\n来自巴尔的摩东部小镇埃利科特城的歌手Lindsey Jordan的艺名。\n\nSnail Mail - Ben Franklin (2021) 能听出来受90s独立摇滚影响很深。\n\n\n\n\n朋克\n\n\n\n\n\nTurnstile - Glow On\n\n\n\nTurnstile\n巴尔的摩的朋克场景受DC的直刃/硬核朋克场景影响很大——强调节奏，拥有口语化、呼喊式的唱腔。最近最火的硬核乐队应该是Turnstile了吧，从21年Glow On发行以来一直在巡演，越巡粉丝越多，压轴了不少音乐节。\n\nTurnstile - T.L.C. (TURNSTILE LOVE CONNECTION) (2021) 典型的Turnstile味。\n\n\n\nAll Time Low\n来自巴尔的摩北边小镇陶森的流行朋克乐队，萌萌的，Blink-182味儿。\n\nAll Time Low - Merry Christmas, Kiss My Ass (2011) 朋友给推荐的，在美国的第一个圣诞节就如此度过…\n\n\n\n\n说唱/嘻哈/舞曲\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Greatest City in America （这个椅子在巴尔的摩随处可见，上书“巴尔的摩-美国最伟大的城市”。果真如此？）\n\n\n\nB’more Club\nNewJeans的Ditto让很多人熟悉了B’more club的欢快节奏；这种发源于巴尔的摩Unruly Records的轻快俱乐部舞曲曾在90年代流行一时，后来延伸出了Jersey Club和Philly Club等流派。后两者现在也很流行。\n\nUnruly Records - Anthology 1991-1995 (2023) 经典的90年代B’more club之声。\nJiaLing - Woe (2024) 台裔巴尔的摩DJ佳玲的作品，B’more club的现代诠释。\nNewJeans - Ditto (2022) 2022年末的Kpop名曲，估计是很多人（包括我）第一次接触这个流派的歌。\n\n\n\nJPEGMafia\n\n\n\n\n\nJPEGMafia - LP!\n\n\n著名的实验说唱rapper，纽约人，搬到巴尔的摩后开始以这个艺名创作音乐。以多变的采样闻名。\n\nJPEGMafia - LP! (2021) 我最喜欢的一张。\n\n\n\n\n线下去哪玩\n\n逛唱片店\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sound Garden, 2024/05\n\n\n\n\n\n唱片店内部\n\n\n\n\n\n门外的标识\n\n\n冷知识：Record Store Day最初就是在巴尔的摩的Fell’s Point发起的，后来逐渐变成了全球性的纪念日。\n\nThe Sound Garden\n号称是全美第二的唱片店（第一是洛杉矶的Amoeba Music），我最爱逛的唱片店，位于宁静美丽的Fell’s Point。一手二手的黑胶CD一应俱全，可以在大甩卖里捡漏；永远放着很酷的音乐，偶尔会有DJ现场打碟；经常会举办新专辑的试听会；还可以买各种周边产品，包括娅娅蜡烛和魔力吸布贴啥的。有相当多的金属唱片，还有一个盯鞋/梦幻流行专区，所有的唱片角上都贴着小小的运动鞋贴纸。总之，氛围一级棒。\n与此相关的奇遇是，24年10月在The Anthem看JAMC的时候瞥见前面站着的一位女士的手机壳里塞了一张The Sound Garden的贴纸，遂迅速上前认亲。女士大赞The Sound Garden是最棒的唱片店。她顺势问我，你年纪这么小为什么来看我们80年代的乐队？我只能满头大汗地尴尬回答我有恋老癖哈哈现在中国年轻人就好这一口盯鞋！\n巴尔的摩还有不少不错的唱片店，不过我最常去的只有这家。\n\n\n\n看现场\n\nOttobar\n位于Charles Village的Ottobar小小的，氛围非常亲切。我在这看了La Luz，基本上就是站在主唱的鞋尖前看的，体验太好了。\n\n\nBaltimore Soundstage\n位于市中心、比Ottobar大一些的场馆，大概千人级别，很棒，无须多言。在这看了Alcest。\n\n\nCFG Bank Arena\n位于市中心的一般通过体育场，the 1975/Charli XCX/Queen在这里演过，但我还是比较偏爱小型场馆。需要注意的是这个场馆旁边就是Howard Street，晚上有很多毒贩，不要单独行动。\n\n\nThe Lyric\n位于Mount Vernon的剧院，魔力吸在这里演过。传说中是为了和霍普金斯的医学院在地理上平衡而建的（东巴尔的摩的医学院太重了，得在西巴尔的摩建一个一样重的大东西才能让地面不翘起来——某位神秘人士曾如此告诉我）。\n每年夏天内港都会举办Baltimore by Baltimore音乐节，会有很多本地音乐人参加，时间合适的话也可以去凑个热闹。除此以外，Fell’s Point也有很多带现场音乐表演的小酒吧。我和朋友在圣帕特里克节曾一起去Sláinte Irish Pub看爱尔兰民谣表演，体验很好！那时整个港口都开满樱花。\n\n巴尔的摩地处美东密集的铁路网中，四舍五入北边的费城（火车1.5小时）和南边的华盛顿（火车1小时）的场馆都算在可达范围内。这一片的中小型场馆也特别多，喜欢的乐队如果不到巴尔的摩来，费城和华盛顿总会来一个。要追到纽约去也不是不行（我甚至追到过波士顿去），就是很难一天往返了。\n\n\n冷知识：美国的第一条铁路就是位于巴尔的摩的B&O Railroad（巴尔的摩-俄亥俄铁路）。这条铁路还有一个博物馆，很有意思的，24年被我们部门租了开retreat。关于这条铁路的另一个冷知识是Johns Hopkins（霍普金斯大学的创始人）当年也有投资B&O Railroad。\n\n\nUnion Transfer（费城）\n我最爱的演出场馆之一，在这看了RIDE和Kim Gordon。在华盛顿看RIDE的时候偶遇了一位乐迷阿姨，她早年干过乐队经纪人，和Union Transfer的老板是老相识；她跟我说此场馆的老板是个盯鞋迷，所以整个场馆的音效都是为了让观众沉浸式感受盯鞋乐队的噪音音墙设计的——只能说名不虚传，在这里听的两场都对我的听力造成了永久损伤。回忆非常幸福，但一定记得带耳塞。据说旁边有家不错的韩国烤肉店。\n\n\n9:30 Club（华盛顿）\n著名的华盛顿演出场馆，很小，很多90s大团成名前都在这演过。我在这看了RIDE，但觉得音效不太得劲，站在第一排反而听不到吉他。验完年龄后会给你的手上盖一个章。有空调，是个优点。里面还有个摆满了CD架的小房子，蛮好玩的。\n\n\nThe Anthem（华盛顿）\n能承载几千人的演出场馆，和9:30 Club是同一个老板。很宽敞，音效一流，服务也一流，人挤人的时候会有工作人员送水。我在这看了JAMC/slowdive/Fontaines DC，Katseye也在这演过，这里还会举办跨年音乐会。位于华盛顿的西南水岸The Wharf，毗邻波多马克河，风景很美丽，离其他著名景点非常近，周围也有很多吃的。很适合一日游，白天逛博物馆，晚上看演出。\n华盛顿周围的其他演出场馆还有The Howard Theater和Silver Spring的The Fillmore等等，都还行，有演出信息都可以关注。\n\n\n\n小贴士\n\nAmtrak的火车票价格和机票一样会波动，一般提前两周到一个月左右买最便宜。MARC Train（只能去华盛顿）车票价格不会波动，但每天发车时间不一样，得参考官网。\n需要注意的是Amtrak一般晚上十点后就都没有班次了，所以如果看晚上的演出需要在当地留宿。费城的Apple Hostel不错。第二天早晨五六点会有红眼火车送你回家，努力一点甚至可以赶得上早八。不要问我怎么知道的。\n如果实在想当天往返，还有两个选择：一个是乘灰狗巴士，华盛顿的巴士站一直开到午夜后，但要注意打车去Union Station巨堵无比，车上条件比较艰苦，巴尔的摩的巴士站也不在霍普金斯的校车范围内，总之不建议独自行动。另一个是自己开车，除了I-95道路上的大坑让开夜车略微危险以外，没啥问题。\n演出票如果在线下买会比线上买便宜15%左右，可以规避Ticketmaster/AXS等购票平台收取的高额服务费。具体怎么买场馆的官网上一般会写（搜box office就行）。\n\n\n\n\n  Kudos ♥",

    "text": "240111 Going Blank Again - Ride\n\n简评\n来自英国牛津的90年代盯鞋乐团ride的二专。与一专nowhere相比，going blank again更加流行、成熟，但保持了ride一贯的清新风格。像一场永不停止的公路旅行，车里的空调调得很舒适，让人轻飘飘的，副驾驶位置上是一只小狗，后座坐着你的童年好友，窗外是飞速掠过的城市灯光和五颜六色的夏花。\n\n\n推荐曲目\n\nTwisterella\n\n‘If I don’t need it anymore, why’s this bus taking me back again?’\n一场90年代的伦敦夜游。迷幻剂和轻飘飘的光与影。歌词和《不能承受的生命之轻》有关，因为主唱Mark Gardener当时在读这本书。\n\nMouse Trap\n\n‘Tricky scenes, tricky little dreams. The Earth spins and my head spins me back ‘round to you’\n前奏是非常清新帅气的扫弦。听了就开心。\n\nLeave Them All Behind\n\n‘Colors shining clear, fading into night. Our grasp is broken, there’s nothing we can do…’\n经典曲目，悬浮于宇宙中一般的体验。现场版非常精彩。\n\nOX4\n\n‘Never been so far away, I don’t think I want to stay in this room anymore’\n想家了。",

    "text": "240117 The Stone Roses\n\n简评\n来自英国曼彻斯特的摇滚乐队石玫瑰，网友们最爱的夏日乐队。主唱Ian的声音像是浮在现实之外，介于呓语和梦话之间。旋转漂浮的riff营造出轻松迷幻的氛围，像嗑了某种让人欣快的药物一样，感觉骨头里的重量被空气一点点吸走，大脑沉浸在一种糖果色的半透明气泡里。\n萨莉肉桂真好听，虽然也不知道这个神秘的魅力到底在哪里。简简单单的但就是没道理地好听。四块二也没有炫技，但简单的节奏/弹法上的变化就让整首歌变得很精巧很可爱。几条riff的制音/不制音的变化非常灵动，特别喜欢。我觉得这首歌有些音的粘滞感其实不是加了delay而是手留在弦上的时间特别长，他真的很会弹。\n感觉石玫瑰的歌的技巧不在酷炫的长段推揉弦solo上，而是那种变化多端的感觉…比如fool’s gold里面鼓贝斯和吉他都非常，轻松？轻盈？现实逐渐远去，而我升入浅紫色的蒸汽中。并且我觉得四块二的riff有一种特殊的气质，就挺艺术的。某种特别的调式或者不太常见的音程吗？最后制作出来的歌又非常悦耳。是个很懂得怎么运用自己擅长的技巧的乐队（与完全以野性为基础的那些相对）。\n\n\n推荐曲目\n\nSally Cinnamon\n\n‘Sent to me from heaven, Sally Cinnamon, you’re my world.’\n美好轻盈得不似真实。女孩给女孩写的情书。我为了这个去买了一支肉桂色的口红。\n\nFool’s Gold\n\n‘I’m no clown, I won’t back down, I don’t need to let you tell me what’s going down’\n四块二的哇音效果器征服所有人。真是骚爆了，所有的配器都是。站在排练室里会有多爽我都不敢想！",

    "text": "240131 The Smiths\n\n简评\n充满罪恶感的一期。这次推荐的是活跃于80年代的曼彻斯特乐队The Smiths。开始听的原因是Ride的吉他手Andy Bell早年的吉他英雄是The Smiths的吉他手Johnny Marr。结果发现是个顾影自怜的社恐（文艺青年，loser，随便怎么说吧）——也就是我——会相当喜欢的乐队……你在生活中发的每一个牢骚都能找到一首对应的歌。 主唱Steven Morrissey很会写歌词，如诗一般，坦白而优美。虽然通过咀嚼自己的忧郁来获得快乐是一种罪恶，但今天就放纵一下吧。\n\n\n推荐曲目\n\nThere is a Light that Never Goes Out - The Queen Is Dead (1986)\n\n‘And if a double-decker bus crashes into us / to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die / If a ten-tonne truck kills the both of us / to die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine’\n和人乘车兜风的时候有没有想过“就是死在这一刻我也愿意”？请听这首。目前是我最喜欢的一首。\n\nHow Soon Is Now? - Hatful of Hollow (1984)\n\n‘You shut your mouth, how can you say / I go about things the wrong way? / I am human and I need to be loved / Just like everybody else does’\n感觉自己被全世界伤害抛弃了？请听这首（会让你陷入更深的抑郁和相伴相随的顾影自怜中）。乐器非常美。\n\nStill Ill - The Smiths (1984)\n\n‘I decree today that life is simply taking and not giving / England is mine / it owes me a living / but ask me why I’ll spit in your eye’\n感觉被整个时代辜负了？请听这首。\n\nI Know It’s Over - The Queen Is Dead (1986)\n\n‘If you’re so funny, then why are you on your own tonight / And if you’re so slever, then why are you own tonight / If you’re so very entertaining, then why are you on your own tonight / if you’re so very good-looking, then why are you on your own tonight’\n被甩了，想被再骂几句？请听这首。\n\nHeaven Knows I’m Miserable Now - Hatful of Hollow (1984)\n\n’I was looking for a job and then I found a job / And heaven knows I’m miserable now / In my life, why do I give valuable time / To people who don’t care if I live or die?’\n明明只是在过日常的生活，甚至过得也挺开心的，但你敏感的内心就是填满了忧郁？请听这首。\n\nPanic - The World Won’t Listen (1987)\n\n‘Burn down the disco / Hang the blessed DJ / Because the music that they constantly play / It says nothing to me about my life’\n被酒吧的狗屎音乐毁了你一天的心情（心情居然可以变得比白天更糟糕吗）？请听这首。\n\nThis Charming Man - The Smiths (1984)\n\n‘I would go out tonight but I haven’t got a stitch to wear / This man said, It’s gruesome that someone so handsome should care’\n如同言情小说一般的homoerotic情节。这首歌让我明白Johnny Marr为什么是Andy的吉他英雄了，相当美丽的吉他（同时也是相当美丽的吉他手）。",

And there was no preconception of what to do.’\n年轻人的第一张电子乐专辑！Get Lucky是很久之前玩明日方舟的时候就听过的歌（因为游戏内致敬了）。Instant Crush是和The Strokes的主唱Julian Casablancas合作的，听了一遍立刻就喜欢上了。\n推荐曲目：Giorgio by Moroder/Instant Crush/Get Lucky\n\n\nGalaxie 500 - The Portable\n\n\n\n‘The heat is just delicious’\n是合集，绿色的封面设计好美。Don’t Let Our Youth Go to Waste是翻唱曲，但感觉Galaxie 500的翻唱曲都有自己独有的味道。Dean在后来的乐队Luna里翻唱的Indian Summer和Ride Into the Sun也都好好听。\n推荐曲目：Blue Thunder (w/ Sax)/Listen, the Snow is Falling/Don’t Let Our Youth Go to Waste\n在此之外还要加一首NGHFB的Council Skies… 刚因为Fuji Rock的宣传片喜欢上这首歌两天，绿洲就重组了！然后高飞鸟就没了！简直不可原谅！！",

Remember to bring your binoculars since there’s a sign saying ‘birds only beyond this point’ - you would not be able to get too close to that rock. The volunteer is very friendly and helpful, and tide pools are also great fun to explore.

Regional: 东北局域线，美铁在东北走廊的普通线路。\nAcela: 美铁的高速线路，这个词是又快又棒的意思（Acceleration & Excellence）。\nMARC-Penn Line: 巴尔的摩到华盛顿的通勤线。\n巴尔的摩的火车站叫宾州站（Penn Station），座落在市区北部的Mount Vernon街区，落成于1911年，是一座美术学院派（Beaux-Arts）建筑。车站前面有供接送车辆使用的小小的圆形广场，外立面饰有庄严的罗马柱，入口挑高大厅的天花板上装着漂亮的圆形玻璃顶。它现在为美铁所有，经过巴尔的摩的客运火车都会停靠在这个车站。\n每个初来乍到巴尔的摩的人看到这个车站都会产生两个困惑：一，车站前面那个苍白的、巨大的、发光的、半男半女的人形雕像到底是什么？二，为什么一个巴尔的摩的车站却叫宾州站？这就和苏州的火车站却叫浙江站一样荒谬。第一个困惑很快就得到了解答：那座雕像就叫做“男人/女人（Male/Female）”，落成于2004年，是美国雕塑家Jonathan Borofsky的作品。这座现代风格的雕塑在落成后就因为与环境格格不入而饱受争议，甚至被称为“巴尔的摩最古怪（kinky）的雕塑”；在一则2021年的新闻中1，这位雕塑家为自己辩护说，最初的构想是把这个小小的圆形广场做成一个绿树成荫的公园，让来往的市民有休息的地方，而不是让这座雕像孤零零——不如说光溜溜地——站在那里；更糟的是，“移动这座雕像要花掉15万至25万美金，并且也没人知道该把它移到哪里去”。我个人倒是蛮喜欢这个雕塑的，Mount Vernon是一个颇有艺术气息的街区，这个大雕塑和旁边马里兰艺术学院（MICA）的建筑群很相配，那颗会发光的心脏也给灰扑扑的街道增添了一丝亮色。第二个问题直到一周前才在和ChatGPT老师的热聊中得到解答——宾州站落成时叫做联合车站，在上世纪是宾夕法尼亚铁路（PRR）的所有物，在1928年改名为宾州站。同属PRR的纽瓦克和纽约火车站也都叫做宾州站，现在也都是美铁的资产了。\n美国的火车没有安检，车会在发车前10分钟左右到站，宾州站也不大，不用像赶上海站的末班车一样跑马拉松。东北走廊的车一般都在E站台发出，站台没有闸机，车票也没有固定座位（可以去坐餐车，桌子比较大），只要在检票员查票的时候出示车票就好，他们会在每个人座位上方行李架的缝隙里塞一张小纸条作为标记。卫生状况略微堪忧，但我很喜欢美铁宽敞的座位，运气好的时候可以一人独占两个。\n\n\n\n\n春日傍晚\n\n\n\n\n\n冬日午后\n\n\n\n从巴尔的摩出发往北乘一个半小时火车就能到达费城。这一段铁路叫费城-威明顿-巴尔的摩铁路（PW&B），建成于19世纪30年代，在1881年被PRR收购，横跨切萨皮克湾和特拉华湾北部，坐靠窗的位置可以时不时看到美丽的海景，有时还能看到彩虹。\n费城的车站叫30街站（30th Street Station），位于思故河畔，是一座落成于1933年的宏伟的新古典主义建筑，也是PRR时代的铁路总站。进站前的一两分钟，火车会驶过I-76快速路下方，视野一下子变得灰暗；但进站后走上台阶就能看到非常宽敞的装饰艺术风格挑高大厅。大厅里最引人注目的就是那座12米高的黄铜雕像“复活天使（Angel of Resurrection）”，它是PRR为了纪念在二战期间牺牲的1307位员工而设置的纪念碑，雕塑的主题是大天使米迦勒从战争的烈焰中救起一位阵亡士兵的灵魂。走过主厅侧边的小走廊就能进入机场线的站台，可以从这里乘火车去费城国际机场；进入车站需要买票过闸机，实际的站台在二楼，有漂亮的玻璃拱顶，一群鸽子在站台里飞来飞去。机场线会绕过费城的大学城，能看到宾大和德雷塞尔大学的校内建筑。\n\n\n\n\n国税局（左）与30街站（右）\n\n\n\n\n\n“复活天使”\n\n\n\n\n\nSEPTA机场线\n\n\n\n从费城往北再坐一个多小时火车就能到纽约。进纽约的过程很像《疯狂动物城》或者《饥饿游戏》里的场景：在纽瓦克站稍作停靠后，火车会驶入一大片荒凉的沼泽地，从窗户望出去能看见生锈的铁轨、废弃的厂房，以及远处若隐若现的曼哈顿天际线；进入曼哈顿岛前，列车会猛地扎入北河隧道——这是一段有110多年历史的老隧道，建于哈得逊河下——最后从位于31街与33街之间的宾州站钻出来。\n\n\n\n\n\n挑战：人在33街了，请在10秒内找到火车站入口\n\n\n不同于费城火车站的宏伟庄严，纽约的宾州站让人摸不着头脑，因为它是一个地下建筑。身为世界第一的大都市（宾州站也是美铁和整个西半球最繁忙的火车站），最大的车站居然没有一个大厅，这多少有点不合情理。我第一次去纽约玩时到站直接转了地铁去下城区，离开的时候乘的是飞机，并没有意识到这个设计的不合理之处。直到后来又去纽约，傍晚捏着手机导航站在33街，下意识地寻找一个高耸的单体建筑，却彻底傻了眼；好不容易找到了位于麦迪逊广场花园（图中左侧的圆形体育馆）下方的入口，面对神似00年代老商场的地下大厅，我在站台门口三过而不入，直到站到车门口之前都在怀疑自己是不是走错到了什么商场里。这种窝囊的体验专业人士早在1962年就吐槽过了——美术史学家Vincent Scully这么说道：“人们曾如天神般进入城市，现在却像老鼠一样仓促逃窜（One entered the city like a god. One scuttles in now like a rat. ）”2。\n让Scully感叹“如天神般”的宾州站地上部分于1910年建成，和巴尔的摩的宾州站一样，也是一座美术学院派建筑；可惜的是，二战后，随着美国铁路客运的衰落，PRR把宾州站的上空权卖了，这座华丽的大厅随后在60年代被拆除，后来建成了现在的麦迪逊广场花园。据说这件事还促成了美国的历史建筑遗产保护运动。纽约人也对此十分不爽，以至于他们终于在接近60年后的2021年又建成了一座新的地上候车厅来弥补这个历史错误——这便是位于第八大道对侧的莫尼汉列车大厅，由曾经的法利邮政大楼改造而成，和被拆除的旧宾州站候车厅同由建筑事务所McKim, Mead & White设计，同样是一座美术学院派建筑。可惜我目前还没有机会去看看这座大厅。\n\n\n上空权——拥有和使用土地上方的空间的权利。在纽约这种寸土寸金的地方，这个概念很重要。",

    "text": "旧时代的遗迹：巴尔的摩-俄亥俄铁路\n之前我们讲到，建于1911年的巴尔的摩宾州站是PRR的资产；但在上一篇文章里我们也提到过，最早通车于1830年的巴尔的摩-俄亥俄铁路（B&O）是美国的第一条铁路。如此辉煌过的大公司居然会把本地的客运线拱手让人吗？这个故事要从B&O公司建立之初说起。\n位于切萨皮克湾北部的巴尔的摩以航运发家，这里的“海盗正规军”私掠船曾在独立战争期间合法劫掠英国船只，赚了不少；但与同为港口城市的纽约不同，纵使狭长的切萨皮克湾给巴尔的摩提供了良好的深水港，它却缺少像伊利运河/哈得逊河那样可以贯通美国中西部粮仓与大西洋沿岸的水运通道。巴尔的摩的商人自然不会愿意把航运带来的巨额利润全盘交给北边的纽约。1827年，在考察了当时的英格兰铁路系统后，一群商人和银行家聚集在巴尔的摩内港西侧的Mount Clare成立了B&O铁路公司，目标是建立一条连接巴尔的摩与俄亥俄河的铁路，这样中西部的粮食就能快速地运抵东部的港口。在之后的60年间，当年开会的地方建成了Mount Clare站和附属的扇形机车库；在1953年，车站被改造为B&O铁路博物馆，存放着纪念B&O公司与美国铁路运输辉煌年代的250件机车车辆。目前，博物馆不仅供游客参观，也对外开放活动场地预约3。\n\n\n\n\nB&O铁路博物馆\n\n\n\n\n\nB&O#4500蒸汽机车头，1918年建于费城的鲍德温机车厂\n\n\n\nB&O旗下的第一条铁路在1830年通车，连接了巴尔的摩与西侧的小镇埃利科特城；1836年，铁轨铺到了马里兰、弗吉尼亚与西弗吉尼亚州交界处的哈珀斯渡口，B&O在这里修建了横跨波多马克河的铁路大桥；1852年，铁路修到了西弗吉尼亚的芒兹维尔，到达了原定的目的地——俄亥俄河；一年后，轨道修到了西弗吉尼亚的惠灵，这是南北战争前B&O铁轨所延伸到的最西端。南北战争后，美国迎来了铁路建设的高潮。1877年，铁路公司的雇员因为不满降薪而在西弗吉尼亚的马丁斯堡发起了震惊全美的大罢工，罢工行动持续了52天，蔓延到了周围的其他五个州，最终在国民警卫队和联邦军队的镇压下结束。1881年，B&O在中大西洋地区的铁轨基本铺设完毕，中西部产的粮食得以源源不断地运到巴尔的摩，再从这里装货并运向欧洲。\n\n\n\n\n\n连接马里兰和弗吉尼亚的哈珀斯渡口，现在是颇受欢迎的远足目的地。\n\n\n从19世纪中叶到20世纪初，B&O和PRR一直在中大西洋地区的交通要道上较劲。早在B&O进军宾州西部的匹兹堡时，PRR就曾向宾州政府施压，试图靠阻挠B&O的西进获得在宾州铁路运输上的垄断地位。在1881年，两家公司也曾抢着要收购连接巴尔的摩和费城的PW&B铁路4。作为东部重镇和B&O的老家，巴尔的摩留存了不少两家公司掰手腕的痕迹。从宾州站往西走两个街区，就能看到B&O当年的主火车站：建于1896年的Mount Royal站，它是一座优雅的新文艺复兴建筑，屋顶覆盖着典雅的红陶瓦，并建有一座46米高的钟楼。19世纪末，为了和PRR的华盛顿-纽约客运线（也就是现在的美铁东北走廊）对抗，B&O推出了Royal Blue客运火车，这种火车漆成华丽的宝蓝色，以豪华周到的服务著称，一定程度上弥补了它不能直接进入曼哈顿岛的遗憾——PRR在1910年修建了横穿哈得逊河的北河隧道，而B&O的乘客只能先在泽西城下车，再换乘轮渡入岛。这段线路也包含了世界上第一条投入干线运营的电气化铁路：铺设在巴尔的摩市区Howard Street下方的电气轨道“Baltimore Belt”使列车得以在城内快速穿梭，连接了B&O城南城北的铁轨， 让从华盛顿到纽约的漫长旅程变得一气呵成。Mount Royal站便设在这条地下轨道的北端，这也是它位于一个“坑”里的原因。\n\n\n\n\nMount Royal站遗址，现属于MICA\n\n\n\n\n\n三月的钟楼\n\n\n\n1958年，B&O放弃了巴尔的摩以北包括Royal Blue在内的所有客运服务，曾经的客运铁路成了货运线（后被相继重组为Chessie System 和CSX），这座火车站也随之废弃。至此，从巴尔的摩北上的客运任务全部落在了属于PRR的宾州站肩上，直到PRR最终因破产被美铁和联合铁路公司重组，而宾州站也成为了美铁的资产。幸运的是，Mount Royal站的旧楼并没有像纽约宾州站一样被推平，而是被MICA接手。现在，这栋楼是艺术生们上课和展示作品的地方。这里离马里兰大学、巴尔的摩大学和剧场The Lyric都很近，秋天树叶会变红，春天会开满樱花，那片碧绿的草坪是散步遛狗的好地方。\n\n\n\n\n\n1922年的内港周边铁路图，橙色：PRR；蓝色：B&O。5\n\n\n当年在巴尔的摩“混战”的铁路公司不止B&O和PRR两家。霍普金斯北校区Wyman Park边建于1918年的混凝土高架桥就是马里兰-宾夕法尼亚（M&P）铁路公司的财产，直到50年代，M&P的火车都从桥洞下穿行而过。\n\n\n\nChessie System由B&O和它和曾经的死对头切萨皮克-俄亥俄铁路（C&O）于1973年重组而成。Chessie本义是传说中活跃在切萨皮克湾的蛇形海怪，但它的标志是一只可爱的打瞌睡的小猫咪。80年代，Chessie与其他东部铁路公司重组为CSX。\n\n\n蒸汽时代给巴尔的摩市区留下了很多痕迹。成为旅游区之前，内港和Fell’s Point曾密布着码头与仓库。内港北边的东西向大道Pratt Street十分宽敞，19世纪中期这条路上曾经铺满B&O的货运铁轨，负责把货物一批批运向码头；这种在城市主干道上强行铺设货运铁轨的做法也曾引发大量争议，因为蒸汽火车的隆隆声打乱了行人和马车的日常步调，市民对此十分不满6,7。Fell’s Point的Thames Street也能看到PRR铺设的铁轨，现在的意大利式餐厅和唱片店都曾经是工人们装卸货物的地方。\n1904年，巴尔的摩市区发生大火，紧邻内港北部的B&O总部大楼和PRR巴尔的摩分公司大楼都被烧毁；巧合的是，两个公司都指派了同一所建筑事务所Parker & Thomas设计新的办公大楼。座落在Charles Street南端的B&O新总部大楼和前面提及的很多车站一样，也是一座美术学院派建筑，门口的大理石拱廊上装饰着古罗马的交通与商业之神墨丘利与一尊代表“工业进步”的人像，13层高的壮观大楼尽情地展示着B&O作为本地龙头企业的骄傲。PRR的楼座落在两个街区以外，是一座较为朴素的红砖建筑。在蒸汽火车不再轰鸣着穿过城市的当下，两座建筑都已移作他用——B&O总部大楼成了金普顿旗下的摩纳哥酒店，PRR的办公楼则开着一家纹身店。\n\n\n\n\nPratt Street宽敞的道路曾经铺满铁轨\n\n\n\n\n\nFell’s Point的铁轨\n\n\n\n\n\n曾经的B&O总部大楼\n\n\n\n\n\n大楼前的拱门",

    "text": "复兴轨道客运：马里兰运输局\n铁路客运的黄金时代结束了，但巴尔的摩复兴轨道公共交通的尝试并未停止。常去华盛顿的人一定知道马里兰通勤铁路（MARC）的存在：只要花上9美元，从宾州站乘一个小时火车，就能快速到达南边的华盛顿特区。这便是全美最快、最繁忙的通勤铁路——属于马里兰运输局（MTA）的MARC-Penn线。这条线路从1984年开始由美铁代理运营，继承了PRR的旧铁轨，从位于萨斯奎哈纳河口的佩利威尔发出，途径马里兰的各个小城（包括位于汉诺威的BWI机场），最后到达华盛顿。除了巴尔的摩的宾州站，沿途的各个小站大多没有华丽的砖石结构建筑，但简单的钢架木结构站台在绿树的掩映中也别有一番风情。身为华盛顿的通勤线，这条线上最常见的乘客便是西装革履、提着公文包的联邦雇员，有时能听见他们乐呵呵地谈论工作八卦，但大多数时候他们只是一言不语地盯着前方，等着上班或者回家。\n华盛顿特区的联合车站（Union Station），毫无悬念地，也是 B&O 与 PRR 两大铁路巨头鼎盛时期的产物。不同于双方在巴尔的摩的明争暗斗，这座位于国会山东北角、落成于1908年的新古典主义杰作是两家公司合作的结果。车站的外墙以联邦首都特色的洁白大理石砌成，辅以庄重的罗马式柱廊与拱门；正门口的屋檐上矗立着六尊名为“铁路的进步（The Progress of Railroading）”的雕塑，分别为代表火的普罗米修斯，代表电的米利都的泰勒斯，代表自由的忒弥斯，代表想象力的阿波罗，代表农业的刻瑞斯，和代表力学的阿基米德。车站的站台和候车厅处在同一层，旅客下车后，穿过低矮的候车厅，便能进入金碧辉煌的玻璃拱顶大厅。每逢岁末，大厅里会树起高大的圣诞树，唱诗班会在这里现场表演，悠扬的歌声让美东下着冷雨的夜晚都变得温暖起来。\n\n\n\n\nMARC-Penn Line路上的小站\n\n\n\n\n\n联合车站入口大厅\n\n\n\n联合车站还可以换乘华盛顿的地铁Metrorail。不同于美国多数城市地铁令人抱歉的设计和老鼠乱爬的卫生状况，华盛顿的地铁是现代主义建筑的杰作。地铁站由芝加哥建筑师Harry Weese于上世纪70年代设计，在当年豪华的联邦预算支持下，这些站台呈现出粗野主义的设计风格：使用清水混凝土砌成藻井式拱顶，采取全间接照明，柔和的光线配合着宽敞的岛式站台设计，营造出丝滑现代、近乎科幻的乘坐体验。联合车站也可以换乘城际交通巴士灰狗（Greyhound），但它令人不敢恭维的卫生与安全状况能瞬间把人从幻想拉回现实。\n除了往返于佩利威尔与华盛顿之间的Penn线，MARC还有另外两条继承了B&O旧铁轨的线路：从华盛顿到巴尔的摩的Camden线，如今最鲜明的功能是把狂热的球迷们运往巴尔的摩金莺队的主场——Camden Yards，球场紧邻的红砖大楼曾经也是B&O的仓库；以及深入马里兰西部阿巴拉契亚山脉的Brunswick线。这两条线我都没乘过，希望以后能有机会能坐坐看。\nMTA旗下的另一个公共交通项目是巴尔的摩轻轨（Baltimore Light RailLink），这条纵贯城市南北、连接市区和郊区的地上有轨列车线路于90年代开通，单程票价为2美元，承载着市政府让搬到郊区的人们重回市中心购物娱乐、振兴城市的愿望8，但结果却不尽人意。在MICA/Mount Royal站附近，铁道环绕在艺术学院风格独特的建筑中，尚存几分日式铁道的娴静氛围；然而，一旦列车驶入Howard Street段——那条曾经属于Royal Blue的辉煌故道——周围的景色就变得不那么令人愉快了。80年代漫长的建设周期加上城市的人口流失成功把这条曾经繁华的商业街变得一片死寂。如今，路边的百货大楼墙皮剥落、空空荡荡，窗户布满灰尘，一些商铺甚至被木条钉死；铺设着轻轨铁道的街上少有行人，所有人都神色匆匆，街边躺着神智不清的流浪汉；CSX的货运列车则轰隆隆地从地下驶过。街上唯一的看点就是风格各异、颜色艳丽的涂鸦了。\n\n\n\n\nMICA/Mount Royal站\n\n\n\n\n\n轻轨边破败的商业区\n\n\n\n\n\n街上的涂鸦\n\n\n\n巴尔的摩的铁路系统见证了城市的兴衰。当基建热潮退去，旧日的设施有的摇身一变，成功转型为更符合当下需求的现代生活空间，有的被彻底拆除，有的则沦为城市身上令人不忍卒看的疮疤。漫步其间，我们依旧能听到铁路黄金时代的轰鸣在这座城市脉搏里的回响。",

    "section": "观后感",
    "text": "观后感\n\n第一集：爱与权力 Love & Power\n这一集讲述的是上世纪颇有影响力的哲学家Ayn Rand，和新自由主义/加州精英主义（相信只要所有人都能做到极度的理性/自私——和电脑一样理性/自私——就可以创造一个全新的、民主的平衡世界）之间的关系。导演试图说明这个电脑+Ayn Rand创造的“人们可以通过个人主义和理性主义来调控世界的乌托邦”是不存在的——聚集在Ayn周围的小群体因为Ayn与其中一位成员的关系而终结了；而在更大的尺度上，这种蔓延至美国领导层的坚信导致了97年左右的亚洲金融危机和09年左右的世界金融危机。\n我觉得这一集的联系有点牵强，或者说偏执。很不喜欢的一点是把Ayn的陨落简单地归于爱情的失败，用一种“爱情一定是非理性的”的态度来攻击她的理性主义。是不是有点太狡猾了呢？看到女人就觉得爱情一定是最终把她击败的困境。我总觉得攻击一个哲学家应该用另一套哲学理论来攻击，而不是用“她没能践行她的哲学”来攻击，这样的话可以攻击的哲学家多了去了。\n\n\n第二集: 群落概念的滥用 The Use and Abuse of Vegetational Concepts\n这一集讲述的是“世界是一个趋向于平衡（equilibrium）的系统”这个概念是如何被发明和滥用的。生态系统是一个稳定的系统。很熟悉吧？大家都是这么想的。但追溯历史的脉络，这个概念其实并未经过严谨的科学验证；它其实是早期的生态学家出于对电脑模型的痴迷、以及一种古老的哲学执念而创造的一个过于简化的模型。这个概念被发明的五十年后，新一代的生态学家已经用数据、实验和建模将其驳倒了。可惜的是，这个概念已经深深地潜入了大众心中。这导致了两个后果：一，大家过于相信“人可以通过点对点的连接组成一个能自我平衡的系统，不需要任何权威/权力结构的维持”，却不知它是不可能长久的。这部分有提到美国70年代嬉皮士们失败的family commune尝试（即他们重新发现了“利维坦”——无组织终将导向混乱，所以每个人必须上交权力给暴力机构以维持必要的稳定状态），21世纪通过互联网连结而发动的没有领导者的革命，等等。 二，政治家滥用这个概念用于维护统治者的权威。“世界是一个平衡的系统，所以政治家要做的仅仅是维持目前的状态”，这种观念让启蒙年代的进步主义消失了，取而代之的是一种不知道该如何前进的虚无。\n这是我最喜欢的一集，可能因为和我的专业知识联系比较紧密吧。我自己也常年处于一种虚无主义漩涡中，被这么激一下也挺好的。\n\n\n第三集: 机器中的猴子，猴子中的机器 The Monkey in the Machine and the Machine in the Monkey\n这一集讲述的是“自私的基因”，上世纪白人精英改变世界的梦想，那位研究山地大猩猩的科学家Fossey，电脑的发明，以及刚果内战之间的联系。“自私的基因”是这样的一套理论：人类的行为，无论是好的还是坏的，实际上都是由存在于我们之上的机器——即我们的DNA组成的巨大计算系统——所控制的，并且一切都为且仅为基因的存续而存在。这套极度理性和非人化的理论实际上导致了荒谬且自相矛盾的后果。理论创立者其一Price因为害怕自己理论的结论而成为了基督徒布道者，但这却导致了更多的伤害；另一位创立者Hamilton成为了极端的进化论信奉者——反对现代医学，因为现代医学会让弱者的基因存续下去；Fossey为了大猩猩的福祉恐吓当地居民，最终被杀死在营地里；由比利时自由主义者发起的刚果民主化进程最终导致了惨无人道的刚果内战。总之就是看似科学理性的出发点却导致了很多道德上的灾难。\n这是我感觉最令人震撼的一集。导演把很多略有耳闻的事件相互串联，加上高超的剪辑手法，达到了可以说是mind-blowing的效果。人类的存在真是荒谬啊。\n\n\n整体观感\n导演的剪辑功力非常强，喜欢用庵野秀明式的“为残忍的画面配上纯净的音乐，为美丽的画面配上悬疑的音乐”手法来制造紧张气氛；第三集开头的一段剪辑简直可以称为吗喽罗曼史，非常震撼，猴核爱好者必看。如果我在大一就看了这个我的期末电影作业也不会拿B-了。\n导演喜欢用全知全能的视角在一个小时里串联起几十年间似乎没有关系的一些事件以讲述道理。这个形式震撼力很强，但有时解释不够，反而让人对他试图证明的理论产生些微怀疑。\n价值观上，导演是个进步/启蒙主义复兴者，可适时酌情打上这一剂猛药来应对现代生活中常有的虚无感；但对于一些概念的解释略有点牵强附会。\n绝对不是无聊的片子，质量非常高，强烈推荐。",

    "text": "✎1774 \n   ♥\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21年给妹写的信，祝贺她考上高中。放在这里是因为忽然发现高中生活已经离我很远、很远了。\n\n\n\n亲爱的妞妞：\n生日快乐！祝贺你考上目标高中！\n本来起草了一篇万字长信，后来一想，没有什么比生日时候收到一封啰啰嗦嗦自鸣得意的说教更扫兴了。于是我把想说的话浓缩成三点：\n\n高中不仅仅是为高考做准备，打开视野，独立思考，尽情享受你的高中生活吧！\n我的语文老师曾说，应试教育是手段，不是目的。鲜活的年轻生命都受不了枷锁，但带着镣铐努力跳完这一段舞，你能看到更广阔的天地。\n心理健康很重要！必要时请向他人寻求帮助。\n\n最后，再次祝你生日快乐！\n渡鸦\nP.S. 礼物说明\n六月底的时候你说想要DND桌游，可惜我暂时没找到正版的，于是送你一套跑团骰子。常言道，扔骰子的意义在于你把它往天上一抛，就知道自己到底想选什么了！\n还有一本是《房思琪的初恋乐园》，不知道你有没有看过。性犯罪比我们想象中的更频繁，千万警惕可能的骚扰行为！\n\n\n\n那篇啰啰嗦嗦自鸣得意的说教\n\n亲爱的妞妞：\n15岁生日快乐！恭喜你升入理想的高中！\n本来想写一篇万字长信，但回头一想，自己如果在生日当天收到一封洋洋自得的所谓“经验总结”，说不定白眼都要翻到天上去。不过分享欲是抑制不住的，如果你有兴趣的话烦请继续看下去啦！\n我的母校XX中学以放浪不羁的校风闻名。受此影响，我认为高中的意义不仅仅是为高考厉兵秣马，更重要的是打开视野，审视自己，学会独立思考，为独立面对社会打下基础。即使不谈这些久远的意义，就谈高中，永远指望着抽象的目标奋斗也是不现实的。尤其是高三的时候，每天的重复劳动会让人怀疑人生，这时候抬头看看窗外像鸽子一样立在枝头的玉兰花，就觉得自己不仅仅是一台答题机器，而是站在这片土地上的一个人。\n不过，既然选择了高考的道路，应试教育便是逃不过的话题。这一点上我并不是专家：我一直是兴趣驱动型的人，纯粹的奋斗不能让我感到快乐——上述的语文老师经常吼我“渡鸦，醒醒！”我能提供的有限经验和教训如下（应该也是老生常谈了）：首先，不要放弃任何一个知识点，尤其是理科，以后补起来得从地基开始补。老师脾气暴躁、阴阳怪气都不重要，不懂就问，不要因为和老师赌气就放弃自己的分数。然后，练习真的有用。高中知识都不会特别难，本质就是刷分，沉住气去练基本上都能练会。最后，成绩波动非常正常。我本人位比有从19%跳水到91%过，物理全卷只做对了三道题，数学十道填空错八道，都熬下来了，顶多关在厕所哭一会儿，找心理老师聊一会儿。\n高中在我心里的另一个意义就是同学情谊。很幸运，我的班级氛围很好，我在这里认识了很铁有趣的朋友和许多非常欣赏的人，每天上课下课叽叽喳喳从火影忍者聊到感受态细菌和电磁场最后一大题，很开心。至于感情——我不知道你是不是这么想的，但我进高中时定下的目标就是：“要有最好的朋友，要有喜欢的人，要有爱好的学科和理想。”其他愿望基本实现，只有喜欢的人这一点以比较悲剧的方式结尾；教训是，如果感情强烈到了伤害自己的地步，最好找个人倾诉一番。无论如何，不要鄙视自己的感情；荷尔蒙会和青春年华一起在几年内迅速褪去，一切经历都是值得珍视的。\n啰嗦到这里，我单独提一下老师。好老师对人的正面影响有多大不必多说。但也有素质不行的老师，从上课一直阴阳怪气贬低学生，到直接上手打上脚踢的都有。这时候不要怕，要知道他才是那个仗着一点权力就胡天胡地的垃圾，自己并不是犯错的那个；必要的情况可以寻求校方或者家长的帮助。并非不信任你的心理素质，只是我的一个高中同学被数学老师贬低到崩溃退学了，非常可惜。一定不能让自己的人生毁在这种人身上。关于性犯罪方面的问题，请参照生日礼物之一《房思琪的初恋乐园》（或许你已经看过）。\n最后，再次祝你生日快乐！六月底的时候你说想要DND桌游，可惜我暂时没找到正版的，于是送你一套跑团骰子，以后遇到什么无法解决的难题，捏住两枚一扔就知道该选什么了～\n送上我最喜欢的女诗人茨维塔耶娃诗一首：\n\n“很快从燕子——变成女巫！ 青春！我们马上将告别…… 让我与你在风中小站片刻！ 我黝黑的青春！请安慰你的姐妹！\n让紫红的裙子像火苗一般闪烁， 我的青春！我肤色黝黑的 小鸽子！我的灵魂的碎片！ 我的青春！安慰我，跳舞吧！\n挥舞着天蓝色的纱巾， 喜怒无常的青春！我俩 尽情儿玩耍！跳吧，跳得热火朝天！ 别了，我金色的青春，琥珀的青春！\n我不无用意地握起你的双手， 像告别情人一般与你告别。 从内心深处迸发出来的青春—— 我的青春！走吧，去找别人！ ”\n\n渡鸦\n\n\n\n\n  Kudos ♥\n\n\n\n© 2024-2026 RavensNest.",

    "text": "✎201 \n   ♥\n\n\nThis weekend I visited Eagle Creek Park near Indianapolis with my friends. It’s freezing outside, so we only walked ~10 minutes on the trail, and saw some Canada geese, ducks, gulls, and coots on water from a distance. I could only identify Canada geese by their larger size compared to other birds &gt;_&lt;\nTo my surprise, the Ornithology Center at the Eagle Creek Park is really good. The ornithology center contains a wild birds rescue center (they’ve rescued a turkey vulture, a bald eagle, and a few owls), a little museum (a great collection of books, field guides, specimen, and memes), an indoor observation station facing the lake (helps a lot when it’s freezing outside, and you can borrow binoculars), and a few bird feeders (you can sit on chairs - indoor or outdoor - and watch birds enjoying their time, and don’t worry, there are anti-collision stickers on the windows). On the windows facing the trail, there are great window paintings - I really like the loon window, and hopefully I can see them during the spring/fall migration periods!\nA very dedicated team curated everything. I pay due respect to all people working there, and we had a great time. Definitely want to visit there again in the future when it’s warmer!\nEagle Creek Park eBird Page\n\n\n\n\n\nBald eagle Carson\n\n\n\n\n\nCarson’s story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuseum\n\n\n\n\n\nBooks and other display\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation station\n\n\n\n\n\nWindow painting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCardinal and sparrow at the feeder\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite breasted nuthatch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Kudos ♥\n\n\n\n© 2024-2026 RavensNest.",

    "text": "✎503 \n   ♥\n\n\n千里奔袭去纽约看万青了。\n在已经完全沉迷于盯鞋的当下，听到4年前最初接触国摇时听的音乐，还是觉得非常触动。不能免俗地，我最喜欢的还是一专的《秦皇岛》。22年寒假前夕，和♫在宿舍里因为所有的一切——疫情、未来——而困惑不已时，我们就在听这首歌。她和我说，秦皇岛是北方人疗养的地方。《秦皇岛》的第一句歌词是“站在能分割世界的桥”。森林公园的桥在白森森的月光下闪耀，我们肩并肩走路，她说她会想起这首歌。我好想在布鲁克林大桥之类的地方唱它呀，可惜Terminal 5周围没有桥。\n怎么感觉我喜欢的歌都是以江河湖海为意象的。能够忍受巴尔的摩的一大原因也是因为它有海——被Sea power和Ride音乐浪漫化以后的大海，一年四季都在盘旋的海鸥，海水里沉沉浮浮的水母……\n新专也好听。感觉全东海岸的中国人都来了。安可的时候我们从2楼跑到1楼，几近在永嘉彗星的节奏里窒息。\n\n站在能分割世界的桥 还是看不清 在那些时刻 遮蔽我们 黑暗的心 究竟是什么\n住在我心里孤独的 孤独的海怪 痛苦之王 开始厌倦 深海的光 停滞的海浪\n站在能看到灯火的桥 还是看不清 在那些夜晚 照亮我们 黑暗的心 究竟是什么\n于是他默默追逐着 横渡海峡 年轻的人 看着他们 为了彼岸 骄傲的 骄傲的 灭亡\n\n\n\n\n  Kudos ♥\n\n\n\n© 2024-2026 RavensNest.",

Over time, I decided to make it more personal. Blogging offers a peaceful online experience without big company manipulation - no ads, no infinite scrolling, no censorship.

You can filter them by tags.\n个人生活/兴趣内容主要用中文写作\n\n\n\nWhy’s it called ‘Raven’s Nest’\n‘Raven’ is my online name, so I adopted it as my logo. Corvids like shiny trinkets, and I think blogging nowadays is like collecting and displaying trinkets online - maybe there are some inherent resemblance?\nWhen I lived in Baltimore, I used to see flocks of crows gathering on trees during colder times at dusk and dawn. Sometimes what you think that are leaves would actually be a flock of birds. I tried to re-create that effect in the homepage XD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024-2026 RavensNest."

    "text": "✎975 \n   ♥\nDefined as naturally occurring or synthesized molecules that fight bacterial infections, antibiotics are one of the most important tools we owe to fight against infectious diseases. The discovery of the first antibiotic in the world - penicillin - by Sir Alexander Fleming in 1928 was a groundbreaking scientific discovery in the fields of medicine and microbiology, and it is also a well-renowned example of serendipity in scientific research – a ‘lucky discovery’.\nIn the past, infectious diseases like smallpox, pneumonia, and tuberculosis were a severe health threat to people, and had accounted for high mortality and morbidity rates. Bloodletting was once the standard treatment for infectious disease, and during the American civil war, topical iodine and mercury-contained compounds were used to treat wounds. After the discovery of Koch’s Postulates in the late 19th century, scientists came to know that microorganisms are the cause of infectious diseases. However, due to a lack of efficient treatments, infectious diseases remain accounting for high mortality worldwide.\nPenicillin was discovered in 1928, purified in 1942, and made widely available in the military in 1945. A golden era of antibiotic discovery followed from the 1950s to the 1970s. Since then, antibiotics have saved countless lives in clinics, and they also served as efficient treatment and prevention methods in agriculture. The discovery of antibiotics revolutionized the field of medical sciences. Even though antibiotic resistance has become a worldwide problem, antibiotics remain widely used in agriculture and clinics nowadays.",

    "section": "Fleming and the Discovery of Penicillin",
    "text": "Fleming and the Discovery of Penicillin\nBefore the discovery of penicillin, Fleming was interested in leukocytes’ ability to destroy bacteria. During 1914-1918, Fleming studied septic wounds and noticed that the chemical antiseptics used that time were more efficient when destroying leukocytes than bacteria, thus making them inefficient treatment to bacterial infections.\nIn September 1928, Fleming was working on the variations of staphylococcus colonies at St. Mary’s Hospital Medical School, and he examined the culture plates with staphylococci with a dissecting microscope, which involved in a temporary removal of the cover, so that the colonies were exposed to the contaminants in the air. Fleming noticed that one unexpected mold colony has developed in one of the culture plates, and a substantial number of staphylococcal colonies around the mold colony underwent lysis – ‘what had originally been a well-grown staphylococcal colony was now a faint shadow of its former self’.\n\n\n\nA penicillin colony cultured by Sir Fleming.\n\n\nFleming then transferred the mold to a culture tube to grow it and found the culture fluid still showed a remarkable antiseptic power. He grew the penicillin mold with a nutrient broth and found that ‘the culture fluid diluted some 500 to 800 times would completely inhibit the growth of staphylococci’, which is 2 to 3 times more efficient as carbolic acid, the chemical antiseptics used at that time. He also developed a qualitative assay to test the difference in the antibacterial ability of penicillin on various kinds of bacteria, which enables him to find the bacteria species that are most susceptible to penicillin (e.g., Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Pneumococcus, Gonococcus). Later, he pointed out that penicillin’s antibacterial effect is limited to gram-positive pathogens. Fleming’s research was reproduced at the Oxford University to isolate the antibiotics. Since the mold belongs to the genus Penicillium, Fleming named the formerly unknown antiseptic substance ‘penicillin’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA noticeable ‘risk’ of Fleming’s work is that the introduction of mold is unintentional - it might be attributed to luckiness. However, Fleming admitted that his background in antiseptics and leukocytes was extremely helpful for him to notice the unexpected change in culture plates.\n\n\n\nHowever, Fleming’s discovery hasn’t got much notice at first, since he was not able to purity the substance or test its antiseptic strength against bacterial infections in humans or animals. Those steps were made possible by the Oxford penicillin team led by Howard Florey, a pathology professor at the Sir William Dunn School at Oxford, and his fellows including Ernst Chain and Norman Heatley. From 1939 to 1941, the team successfully purified the substance, developed methods for large-scale isolation and production, and carried out the first mouse and human trails of penicillin treatment.\nIn 1945, Fleming, Florey and Chain together won the Nobel Prize in Physiology/Medicine for the discovery and use of the antibiotic agent, which since then had saved millions of lives.\n\n\n\nLeft: Sir Fleming in his lab.

Waksman was given the 1952 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology. However, several female researchers who contributed greatly to the program were barely mentioned in this story, including E. S. Horning, who developed an efficient screening protocol to isolate soil microbes and E. J. Bugie, who collaborated in the streptomycin discovery paper but got her name removed for the patent. At that time, women in science were underrepresented - their contributions to the projects were intentionally ignored, not to mention that their role as strong supporters for their husbands are usually overlooked.\n\n\n\nThe forgotten women scientists in Streptomycin research.",

    "text": "The Impact of Antibiotics\nThe discovery of penicillin and many other antibiotics have saved countless lives on this planet. After WWII, war-time innovations including antibiotics were used to fight against infectious disease globally. For example, people found that a combination of antibiotics can cure tuberculosis, which was not possible before WWII. Antibiotics were also used in food production industry to promote growth, prevent infection, and treat diseases of animals and plants, which effectively boosted food production and contributed to the huge global population growth in the later 20th century. Nevertheless, the intensive use of antibiotics over the years have resulted in the prevalence of antibiotic resistance, which has led to increasing concern about its influence on animal and human health. An example would be ‘superbugs’ in the clinics – they are multidrug resistant bacteria strains (e.g., C. difficile) that cannot be simply eliminated by antibiotics.\nAntibiotics was one of the most important medical advances in the 20th century, however, due to excessive use, its resistance has become prevalent in nature. In the future, more caution should be given when using antibiotics, and antibiotic resistance surveillance should also receive enough attention from public health organizations.\n\n\n\n  Kudos ♥",

Discovered by J. A. Arfvedson in 1817 as an alkali metal during mineral petalite analysis, lithium was first introduced to the medical field in 1859 as a treatment of gout (a disease in which patients accumulate urate crystals in their joints) by Alfred Barring Garrod due to its ability to dissolve urate stones4. Early implementation of lithium in psychiatric diseases treatment was based on the popular assumption in 19th century, that ‘uric acid diatheses’ could lead to a series of symptoms ranging from gout to mental illness, but due to lack of technologies to monitor blood levels in patients, lithium treatment was abandoned due to its toxicity4.",

    "text": "John Cade, the Untrained Psychiatrist Who Re-discovers Lithium’s Treatment Effects\nThe re-discovery of lithium’s treatment effects in mania was not made possible until the 1940s. The Australian psychiatrist John Cade, retired from World War II, set up a largely amateur laboratory in the woodsheds of the hospital he worked in in rural Australia. Based on the assumption that ‘mania-depressive illness’ is analogous to thyrotoxicosis and myxedema – that one state of the illness can be attributed to the excess of one substance in the body and the other state can be attributed to the lack of the same substance, Cade wanted to find the excess substance in mania patients. The psychiatrist injected urine collected from mania patients and normal people into the abdominal compartments of guinea pigs and found the former was more toxic in killing animals. He therefore decided to test the uric acid’s toxicity in guinea pigs and happened to use lithium urate – the most soluble form of urate – in his experiments.\nTo his astonishment, lithium urate protected the animals from dying compared to pure urea solution, and he subsequently found that injection of lithium carbonate aqueous solution can make guinea pigs lethargic and unresponsive to stimuli for a long period. Cade therefore tried to apply lithium as a treatment for manic, depressed, and schizophrenic patients and found its effects most evident in manic patients4. Cade’s early conclusions were re-investigated and confirmed by Mogens Schou’s clinical investigations in the 1950s in Denmark, followed by the discovery of its prophylactic effects in BD and recurrent depression.\nSince the 1960s, when blood pressure level measurement was made possible by the employment of a flame spectrophotometer, lithium has been widely applied in BD treatment ever since4. At the time of treating psychiatric diseases by electroconvulsive therapy (introducing seizures electrically) and lobotomy (severing the connections of patients’ prefrontal cortex), lithium was the first effective medication available to significantly alleviate the symptoms of a mental illness.",

    "text": "A Story of Serendipity that is Problematic under Modern Research Standards\nThe re-discovery of lithium’s treatment effects by John Cade was largely portrayed as a story of serendipity – a story where a false hypothesis or theory leads to an empirically correct conclusion4. The U.S. psychiatrist Walter A. Brown believes that a systematic process might be at play behind the myth of ‘lucky discovery by an amateur scientist’. In his book Lithium: A Doctor, a Drug, and a Breakthrough5, Brown points out that the discovery of lithium’s drug effect is a paradox, where Cade’s experiments were problematic regarding hypothesis, sample storage, observed effects (the guinea pigs may be intoxicated to appear ‘sedated’), and research ethics – such research would not be approved by modern research institutions, but its discovery was indeed distinctive. It has reshaped people’s view of mental illnesses as treatable diseases and saved millions of lives ever since.\n\n\n\n  Kudos ♥",
